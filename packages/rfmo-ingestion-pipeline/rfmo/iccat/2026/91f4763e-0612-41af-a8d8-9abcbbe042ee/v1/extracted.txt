ICCAT·CICTA·CICAA Home MCS Initiatives At the 2023 Meeting of the Compliance Committee, the Compliance Committee endorsed the creation of a meeting document that could serve as a repository for compliance-related capacity-building opportunities from both within and outside of ICCAT (including from CPCs and other organizations). As a first step towards building this repository, in 2024 prior to the 24th Special Meeting of the Commission, the ICCAT Secretariat invited CPCs to report any compliance-related capacity-building initiatives currently on offer or technical assistance opportunities in which the CPC plays a role that involves building capacity in fisheries governance, management, and science of potential relevance to ICCAT, even if not directly targeted at international fisheries or ICCAT (see &ldquo;Request for information on compliance-related capacity building initiatives&rdquo; ICCAT #Circular 08174/2024 ). Please click here to view the information received to date. This document will be updated by the ICCAT Secretariat as new or revised information is received, including during the intersessional period. CPCs are encouraged to submit any new or updated information to the ICCAT Secretariat using the template provided, as soon as it becomes available. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Close Close &nbsp; --> Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window Close Open document in a new window
