The Compendium generally includes the Recommendation and Resolutions that are currently in force (even if only part of a particular measure is still in effect), as well as those that while they may no longer be in force but have a direct bearing on a current measure. To facilitate the use of this information, the measures are assigned a reference number. The two -digit year code corresponds to the year of adoption by the Commission) (e.g. 94-01, 97-07, 99-11, etc). In 2003, the Secretariat made a thorough review of all past reports of Commission Meetings to compile a complete historical Compendium of all Recommendations, Resolutions and other major decisions adopted by ICCAT. This has been updated in 2026 to include the Resolutions adopted in 2025. An interactive version of the full ICCAT Compendium of management decisions is now available on the ICCAT web page . This version allows users to access Recommendations and Resolutions by category, by year, by status (in force or inactive) or by number. The Compendium is classified according to major subjects as follows: Species: TRO – BET (Bigeye tuna), YFT (Yellowfin tuna), SKJ (Skipjack tuna) SWO (Swordfish) ALB (Albacore) BFT (Bluefin tuna) BIL (Billfishes) SHK (Sharks) BYC (Other bycatch species) Monitoring and Compliance: GEN (General issues) SANC (Sanctions, trade-related measures) SDP (Statistical Document Programs) Other: TOR (Terms of

.............................................................................................. 621 1 16-01 TRO RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON A MULTI-ANNUAL CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME FOR TROPICAL TUNAS (Entry into force 12 June 2017) CONSIDERING that the further implementation of a multi-annual programme for the medium-term will contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of the tropical tunas fishery; RECOGNIZING the necessity to adopt monitoring and control measures to ensure implementation of conservation and management measures and to improve the scientific assessment of those stocks; RECOGNIZING the necessity to adopt data collection and transmission mechanisms to allow improvement of the monitoring and the scientific assessment of the related fisheries and associated stocks; NOTING that further to the SCRS assessment conducted in 2015, the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) concluded that the bigeye tuna stock is overfished and that overfishing is occurring; CONSIDERING that the SCRS recommended taking measures to reduce the bigeye TAC to levels that would allow a recovery with a high degree of probability and within a short timeframe and to find effective measures to reduce FAD-related and other fishing mortality of small bigeye tunas; RECOGNISING that, in view of the state of the stock, it would be appropriate to carry out the stock assessment of bigeye in 2018; RECOGNIZING that the SCRS concluded that the current area/time closure has not been effective at reducing the mortality of juvenile bigeye tuna, and any reduction in yellowfin tuna mortality was minimal, largely due to the redistribution of effort into areas adjacent to the moratorium area; RECOGNIZING the contribution that a reduction in the harvest of juvenile tunas in the Gulf of Guinea can contribute to the long-term sustainability of the stocks; NOTING that Recommendation 14-01 brought the coverage of national observers for purse seiner fishing for tropical tunas during the area/time closure period from the minimum of 5% of the fishing effort established by Recommendation 16-14 to a 100% coverage of fishing; CONSIDERING that the SCRS concluded that current level of scientific observers (5%) seems to be inappropriate to provide reasonable estimates of total by-catch and recommended increasing the minimum level to 20%. FURTHER CONSIDERING that the SCRS recommended studying the issue further, in order to determine the level of coverage appropriate to meet management and scientific objectives; RECOGNIZING that the SCRS noted that the current mandatory level of observer coverage of 5% may have not been implemented by many of the fleets and underlined the need for achieving those minimum coverages so as the SCRS could address the mandate given by the Commission; RECOGNIZING that the SCRS also notes that some fleets are currently implementing voluntary observer programmes that cover 100% of the fishing trips and that it also acknowledged the efforts conducted by some fleets to increase the observer coverage to 100% of the trips; RECALLING recommendations by the SCRS to address the lack of reliable data collection mechanisms, particularly in tropical tuna fisheries carried on in association with objects that could affect fish aggregation, including FADs; FURTHER RECALLING that as regards skipjack tunas SCRS stated in its 2014 report that the increasing use of FADs since the early 1990s has changed the species composition of free swimming schools, and that association with FADs may also have an impact on the biology and on the ecology of yellowfin and skipjack tunas; 2 NOTING that, according to the 2014 SCRS advice, increasing harvests and fishing effort for skipjack could lead to involuntary consequences for other species that are caught in combination with skipjack in certain fisheries; NOTING that in its 2013 report, SCRS recognized the effect of FADs on both sea -turtle and shark by - catch and the need to provide advice on the design of FADs that would lessen their impact on by -catch species. Therefore, information on dimension and material of t he floating part and of the underwater hanging structure should be provided. More particularly the entangling or non -entangling feature of the underwater hanging structure should be reported; FURTHER NOTING that the activities of supply vessels and the use of FADs are an integral part of the fishing effort exerted by the purse seine fleet; RECALLING measures related to FAD management plans in other tuna RFMOs; CONSIDERING that the multispecies characteristics of the tropical tuna fisheries makes it appropriate to extend to skipjack tuna the multi -annual management and conservation plan for yellowfin and bigeye tuna; RECALLING that the FAO International Guidelines on by-catch management and reduction of discards strongly encourage RFMOs to recognise the importance of addressing by-catch and discards; RECOGNISING that it is appropriate to better manage by -catch and reduce discard practices in ICCAT fisheries, also taking into account food security issues and the importance to improve data collection for scientific purposes; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the recommendations of the 2016 ICCAT ad -hoc Working Group on FADs, which were endorsed by the SCRS at its 2016 meeting; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: PART I GENERAL PROVISIONS Multi-annual Management and Conservation Programme 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) whose vessels fish bigeye and/or yellowfin tunas in the Convention area shall implement the Multi -annual Management and Conservation Programme initiated in 2012. As from 2015, such programme shall also apply to the eastern stock of skipjack tuna. PART II CATCH LIMTS Catch limits for bigeye tuna 2. The annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for 2016 and subsequent years of the Multi -annual Programme is 65,000 t for bigeye tuna. The following shall apply: a) If the total of catches exceeds the TAC in a given year, the excess amount shall be paid back by CPCs to which a catch limit has been granted for the species concerned. Excess quantities shall be deducted the following year on a prorata basis from the adjusted quotas/catch limits of the CPC concerned, as per paragraphs 9 and 10. b) The TAC and catch limits for 2016 and subsequent years of the Multi -annual Programme shall be adjusted based on the latest scientific assessment available. Whatever the outcome, the relative shares used to establish the annual catch limits for the CPCs appearing in paragraph 3 shall remain unchanged. 3 3. The following catch limits shall be applied for 2016 and subsequent years of the Multi -annual Programme to the following CPCs: CPC Annual catch limits for the period 2016-2018 (t) China 5,376 European Union 16,989 Ghana 4,250 Japan 17,696 Philippines 286 Korea 1,486 Chinese Taipei 11,679 4. Catch limits shall not apply to CPCs whose annual catch of bigeye tuna in the Convention area in 1999, as provided to the SCRS in 2000, is less than 2,100 t. However, the following shall apply: a) CPCs which are not developing coastal States shall endeavour to maintain their annual catch less than 1,575 t. b) if the catch of bigeye tuna of any developing coastal CPC not listed in paragraph 3 above exceeds 3,500 t in any given year, a catch limit shall be established for that developing CPC for the following years. In such a case, the relevant CPC shall endeavou r to adjust its fishing effort so as to be commensurate with their available fishing possibilities. 5. CPCs shall report quarterly the amount of bigeye caught by vessels flying their flag to the Secretariat by the end of the following quarter. When 80% of the catch limit or threshold for a CPC is exceeded, the Secretariat shall notify that to all CPCs. 6. If the total catch exceeds in any year the TAC in paragraph 2, the Commission shall review these measures. Quota transfers of bigeye tuna 7. The following annual transfer of bigeye tuna shall be authorized in 2016-2018: a) from Japan to China: 1,000 t b) from Japan to Ghana: 70 t 8. Notwithstanding the Recommendation by ICCAT Regarding the Temporary Adjustment of Quotas [Rec. 01-12], in between meetings of the Commission, a CPC with a catch limitation of bigeye tuna as per paragraph 3 may make a one -time transfer within a fishing year of up to 15% of its catch limit to other CPCs with catch limits, consistent with domesti c obligation and conservation considerations. Any such transfer shall be notified to the Secretariat in advance and may not be used to cover over harvests. A CPC that receives a one-time catch limit transfer may not re-transfer that catch limit. Underage or overage of catch of bigeye tuna 9. Underage or overage of an annual catch limit for CPCs listed in paragraph 3 for bigeye tuna may be added/to or shall be deducted from the annual catch limit as follows: Year of catch Adjustment Year 2015 2016 and/or 2017 2016 2017 and/or 2018 2017 2018 and/or 2019 2018 2019 and/or 2020 4 However, a) The maximum underage that a CPC may carry over in any given year shall not exceed 15% of its annual initial catch limit; b) For Ghana, the overage catch of bigeye tuna in the period 2006 to 2010 shall be repaid by reducing the catch limit of Ghana for bigeye tuna by a yearly amount of 337 t for the period 2012 to 2021. 10. Notwithstanding paragraph 9 if any CPC exceeds its catch limit during any two consecutive years, the Commission will recommend appropriate measures, which may include, but are not limited to, reduction in the catch limit equal to a minimum of 125% of the excess harvest, and, if necessary, trade restrictive measures. Any trade measures under this paragraph will be import restrictions on the subject species and consistent with each CPC’s international obligations. The trade measures will be of such duration and under such conditions as the Commission may determine. TAC for yellowfin tuna 11. The annual TAC for 2012 and subsequent years of the Multi -annual Programme is 110,000 t for yellowfin tuna and shall remain in place until changed based on scientific advice. If the total catch exceeds the TAC for yellowfin tuna, the Commission shall review the relevant conservation and management measures in place. PART III CAPACITY MANAGEMENT MEASURES Capacity limitation for bigeye tuna 12. A capacity limitation shall be applied for the duration of the Multi -annual Programme, in accordance with the following provisions: a) The capacity limitation shall apply to vessels 20 meters length overall (LOA) or greater fishing bigeye tuna in the Convention area. b) CPCs which have been allocated a catch limit in accordance with paragraph 3 shall each year: i. Adjust their fishing effort so as to be commensurate with their available fishing possibilities; ii. Be restricted to the number of their vessels notified to ICCAT in 2005 as fishing for bigeye tuna. However, the maximum number of longline and purse seine vessels shall each year be subject to the following limits: CPC Longliners Purse seiners China 65 - EU 269 34 Ghana - 17 Japan 231 - Philippines 5 - Korea 14 - Chinese Taipei 75 - c) Ghana shall be allowed to change the number of its vessels by gear type within its capacity limits communicated to ICCAT in 2005, on the basis of two baitboats for one purse seine vessel. Such change must be approved by the Commission. To that end, Ghana shall notify a comprehensive and detailed capacity management plan to the Commission at least 90 days before the Annual Meeting. The approval is notably subject to the assessment by the SCRS of the potential impact of such a plan on the level of catches. 5 d) The capacity limitation shall not apply to CPCs whose annual catch of bigeye tuna in the Convention area in 1999, as provided to the SCRS in 2000, is less than 2,100 t. e) Curaçao shall be allowed to have up to 5 purse seiners. f) El Salvador shall be allowed to have up to 4 purse seiners. g) For CPCs for which a capacity limitation applies, vessels fishing tropical tunas in the Convention area may be replaced only by vessels of equivalent capacity or lesser vessels. PART IV MANAGEMENT OF FADs Area/Time closure in relation with the protection of juveniles 13. Fishing for, or supported activities to fish for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas in association with objects that could affect fish aggregation, including FADs, shall be prohibited during the period 1 January to 28 February in the following area: − Southern limit: parallel 4º / South latitude − Northern limit: parallel 5º / North latitude − Western limit: meridian 20º / West longitude − Eastern limit: the African coast 14. The prohibition referred to in paragraph 13 includes: − launching any floating objects, with or without buoys; − fishing around, under, or in association with artificial objects, including vessels; − fishing around, under, or in association with natural objects; − towing floating objects from inside to outside the area. 15. As soon as possible and at the latest by 2018, the SCRS shall evaluate the efficacy of the area/time closure referred to in paragraph 13 for the reduction of catches of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tunas. In addition the SCRS shall advise the Commission on a possible alternative area/time-closure of fishing activities on FADs to reduce the catch of small bigeye and yellowfin tuna at various levels. Limitation of FADs 16. CPCs shall ensure that for purse seiners flying their flag and fishing for bigeye, yellowfin or skipjack tunas on FADs the following provisional limits are not exceeded: - No more than 500 FADs with or without instrumental buoys are active at any one time in relation to each of its vessels through such measures as, for example, the verification of telecommunication bills. 17. The Commission shall review the provisional limits laid down in paragraph 16 at its 2017 Annual meeting following the advice of SCRS and the conclusions of the Ad Hoc Working Group on FADs. FAD Management Plans 18. CPCs with purse seine and baitboat vessels fishing for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas in association with objects that could affect fish aggregation, including FADs, shall submit to the Executive Secretary Management Plans for the use of such aggregating devices by vessels flying their flag at least one week in advance to the 2016 meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group on FADs and subsequently by 31 January each year. 6 19. The objective of the FAD Management Plans shall be to: i. improve the knowledge about FAD characteristics, buoy characteristics, FAD fishing, including fishing effort of purse seiners and associated support vessels, and related impacts on targeted and non-targeted species; ii. effectively manage the deployment and recovery of FADs, the activation of buoys and their potential loss; iii. reduce and limit the impacts of FADs and FAD fishing on the ecosystem, including, where appropriate, by acting on the different components of the fishing mortality (e.g. number of deployed FADs, including number of FAD’s set by purse seiners, fishing capa city, number of support vessels). 20. The Plans shall be drawn up by following the Guidelines for Preparation for FAD Management Plans as provided in Annex 6. FAD logbook and list of deployed FADs 21. CPCs shall ensure that all purse seine and baitboat fishing vessels and all support vessels (including supply vessels) flying their flag, and/or authorized by CPCs to fish in areas under their jurisdiction, when fishing in association with or deploying fi sh aggregating devices (FADs), including objects that could affect fish aggregation (e.g. carcasses, trunks) shall collect and report, for each deployment of a FAD, each visit on a FAD, whether followed or not by a set, or each loss of a FAD, the follo wing information and data: (a) Deployment of any FAD i. Position ii. Date iii. FAD type (anchored FAD, drifting artificial FAD) iv. FAD identifier (i.e., FAD Marking and buoy ID, type of buoy – e.g. simple buoy or associated with echo-sounder) v. FAD design characteristics (material of the floating part and of the underwater hanging structure and the entangling or non-entangling feature of the underwater hanging structure) (b) Visit on any FAD i. Type of the visit (deployment of a FAD and/or buoy 0F 1, retrieving FAD and/or buoy, strengthening/consolidation of FAD, intervention on electronic equipment, random encounter (without fishing) of a log or a FAD belonging to another vessel, visit (without fishing) of a FAD belonging to the vessel, fishing set on a FAD1F 2) ii. Position iii. Date iv. FAD type (anchored FAD, drifting natural FAD, drifting artificial FAD) v. FAD identifier (i.e., FAD Marking and buoy ID or any information allowing to identify the owner) vi. If the visit is followed by a set, the results of the set in terms of catch and by -catch, whether retained or discarded dead or alive. If the visit is not followed by a set, note the reason (e.g. not enough fish, fish too small, etc.) (c) Loss of any FAD i. Last registered position ii. Date of the last registered position iii. FAD identifier (i.e., FAD Marking and buoy ID) 1 Deploying a buoy on a FAD includes three aspects: deploying a buoy on a foreign FAD, transferring a buoy (which changes the F AD's owner) and changing the buoy on the same FAD (which does not change the FADs owner). 2 A fishing set on a FAD includes two aspects: fishing after a visit to a vessel’s own FAD (targeted) or fishing after a random encounter of a FAD (opportunistic). 7 For the purpose of the collection and the report of the information referred to above and where paper or electronic logbooks already in place do not allow it, CPCs shall either update their reporting system or establish FAD-logbooks. In establishing FAD logbooks, CPCs should consider using the template laid down in Annex 2 as reporting format. When using paper logbooks, CPCs may seek, with the support of the Executive Secretary, for harmonized formats. In both cases, CPCs shall use the minimum standards recommended by SCRS in Annex 3. 22. CPCs shall also ensure that all vessels referred to in paragraph 21 keep updated on a monthly basis and per 1°x1° statistical rectangles a list of deployed FADs and buoys, containing at least the information as laid down in Annex 4. Reporting obligations on FADs and on support vessels 23. CPCs shall ensure that the following information is submitted every year to the Executive Secretary in a format provided by the ICCAT Secretariat. This information shall be made available to the SCRS and to the Ad Hoc Working Group on FADs in a database developed by the the ICCAT Secretariat: i. the number of FADs actually deployed on a monthly basis per 1°x1° statistical rectangles, by FAD type, indicating the presence or absence of a beacon/buoy or of an echo -sounder associated to the FAD and specifying the number of FADs deployed by associated support vessels, irrespective of their flag; ii. the number and type of beacons/buoys (e.g. radio, sonar only, sonar with echo-sounder) deployed on a monthly basis per 1°x1° statistical rectangles; iii. the average numbers of beacons/buoys activated and deactivated on a monthly basis that have been followed by each vessel; iv. average numbers of lost FADs with active buoys on a monthly basis; v. for each support vessel, the number of days spent at sea, per 1° grid area, month and flag State; vi. purse seine and baitboat catches, efforts and number of sets (for purse seines) by fishing mode (floating-object associated schools and free school fisheries) in line with Task 2 data requirements (i.e. per 1°x1° statistical rectangles and per month); vii. when the activities of purse seine are carried out in association with baitboat, report catches and effort in line Task 1 and Task 2 requirements as “purse seine associated to baitboats” (PS+BB). Non-entangling and biodegradable FADs 24. In order to minimize the ecological impact of FADs, in particular the entanglement of sharks, turtles and other non-targeted species, and the release of synthetic persistent marine debris, CPCs shall: i. replace by 2016 existing FADs with non -entangling FADs in line with the guidelines under Annex 7 of this Recommendation. ii. undertake research to gradually replace existing FADs with fully biodegradable and non-entangling FADs, with a view to phase out non-biodegradable FADs by 2018, if possible. CPCs shall report on an annual basis on the steps undertaken to comply with these provisions in their FADs Management Plans. PART V CONTROL MEASURES Specific authorization to fish for tropical tunas 25. CPCs shall issue specific authorizations to vessels 20 meters LOA or greater flying their flag allowed to fish bigeye and/or yellowfin and/or skipjack tunas in the Convention area, and to vessels flying their flag used for any kind of support of this fishing activity (hereafter referred to as "authorized vessels"). 8 ICCAT Record of authorized tropical tuna vessels 26. The Commission shall establish and maintain an ICCAT record of authorized tropical tuna vessels, including support vessels. Fishing vessels 20 meters LOA or greater not entered into this record are deemed not to be authorized to fish, retain on board, tra nship, transport, transfer, process or land bigeye and/or yellowfin and/or skipjack tunas from the Convention area or to carry out any kind of support to those activities, including deploying and retrieving FADs and/or buoys. 27. A CPC may allow by-catch of tropical tunas by vessels not authorized to fish for tropical tunas pursuant to paragraph 25 and 26, if this CPC establishes a maximum onboard by-catch limit for such vessels and the by-catch in question is accounted for within the CPC's quota or catch limit. Each CPC shall provide in its Annual Report the maximum bycatch limit it allows for such vessels. That information shall be compiled by the ICCAT Secretariat and made available to CPCs. 28. CPCs shall notify the list of authorized vessels to the Executive Secretary in an electronic form and in accordance with the format set in the Guidelines for Submitting Data and Information Required by ICCAT. 29. CPCs shall, without delay, notify the Executive Secretary of any addition to, deletion from and/or modifications of the initial list. Periods of authorization for modifications or additions to the list shall not include dates more than 45 days prior to the date of submission of the changes to the Secretariat. The Secretariat shall remove from the ICCAT Record of Vessels any vessel for which the periods of authorization have expired. 30. The Executive Secretary shall, without delay, post the record of authorized vessels on the ICCAT website, including any additions, deletions and/or modifications so notified by CPCs. 31. Conditions and procedures referred to in the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels 20 meters in Length Overall or Greater Authorized to Operate in the Convention Area [Rec. 13-13]2F 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the ICCAT record of authorized tropical tuna vessels. Vessels actively fishing tropical tunas in a given year 32. Each CPC shall, by 31 July each year, notify to the Executive Secretary the list of authorized vessels flying their flag which have fished bigeye and/or yellowfin and/or skipjack tunas in the Convention area or have offered any kind of support to the fishing activity (support ve ssels) in the previous calendar year. For purse seines this list shall also include the support vessels that have supported the fishing activity, irrespective of their flag. The Executive Secretary shall report each year these lists of vessels to the Compliance Committee and to the SCRS. 33. The provisions of paragraphs 25 to 32 do not apply to recreational vessels. Recording of catch and fishing activities 34. Each CPC shall ensure that its vessels 20 meters LOA or greater fishing bigeye and/or yellowfin and/or skipjack tunas in the Convention area record their catch in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex 1 and in the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Recording of Catch by Fishing Vessels in the ICCAT Convention Area [Rec. 03-13]. 3 This measure was repealed and replaced by Recommendation 21-14. 9 Identification IUU activity 35. The Executive Secretary shall, without delay, verify that any vessel identified or reported in the context of this Multi-annual Programme is on the ICCAT record of authorized vessels and not out of compliance with the provisions of paragraphs 13 and 14. If a possible violation is detected, the Executive Secretary shall, without delay, notify the flag CPC. The flag CPC shall immediately investigate the situation and, if the vessel is fishing in relation to objects that could affect fish aggregation, including FADs, request the vessel to stop fishing and, if necessary, leave the area without delay. The flag CPC shall, without delay, report to the Executive Secretary the results of its investigation and the corresponding measures taken. 36. The Executive Secretary shall report to the Compliance Committee at each annual meeting of the Commission on any issue related to identification of unauthorized vessels, the implementation of the VMS, the observer provisions, and the results of the relevant investigation made as well as any relevant measures taken by the flag CPCs concerned. 37. The Executive Secretary shall propose to include any vessels identified in accordance with paragraph 36, or vessels for which the flag CPC has not carried out the required investigation and taken, if necessary, adequate measures in accordance with paragraph 35, on the provisional IUU list. Observers and compliance with area/time closure 38. Each CPC shall: a) Take appropriate action to ensure that all vessels flying its flag, including support vessels, when engaged in fishing activities during the area/time closure referred to in paragraph 13, have an observer on board in accordance with Annex 5 and report the information collected by the observers each year by 31 July to the ICCAT Secretariat and to SCRS; b) Take appropriate action against vessels flying their flag that do not comply with the area/time closure referred to in paragraph 13; c) Submit an Annual Report on their implementation of the area/time closure to the Executive Secretary, who shall report to the Compliance Committee at each Annual Meeting. Scientific Observers 39. For scientific observers on board vessels targeting bigeye, yellowfin and/or skipjack tunas in the area east of meridian 20º/West longitude and north of parallel 28º/ South latitude the following shall apply: a) Scientific observers shall automatically be recognized by all CPCs. Such recognition shall allow the scientific observer to continue the collection of data throughout the EEZ visited by the vessel observed. The coastal CPCs concerned shall receive from th e flag CPC which mandated the observer the scientific information collected by the observer and related to fishing activities on ICCAT species in their EEZ. b) CPCs that do not accept that their national scientific observer may collect data in the EEZ of another CPC, or that do not recognize as valid the data collected in their EEZ by a scientific observer of another CPC, must inform the Executive Secretary, for immediate transmission to the SCRS and the Compliance Committee, of their refusal within three months after the entry into force of this Recommendation or their accession to ICCAT. By such refusal, the CPC concerned shall refrain to require the deployment of its national scientific observer on vessels of another CPC. 40. For purse seine and longline vessels flying their flag 20 meters length overall (LOA) or greater targeting bigeye, yellowfin and/or skipjack in the Convention area, CPCs are encouraged to increase the observer coverage stipulated in Recommendation 16-14, in line with the 2016 SCRS recommendations. 41. The ICCAT Secretariat shall compile the information collected under domestic observer programs, including on the observer coverage for each tropical tuna fishery, and make it available to the Commission before the 2017 Annual Meeting for further deliberation. 10 42. In 2017 the SCRS shall review its 2016 recommendations on observer coverage and advise the Commission on appropriate coverage levels for each tropical tuna fishery, taking in consideration the full suite of monitoring tools in the fishery. Port Sampling Programme 43. The port sampling programme developed by the SCRS in 2012 aimed at collecting fishery data for bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack tunas that are caught in the geographical area of the area/time closure referred to in paragraph 13 for surface fishery shall be continued for landing or transhipment ports. Data and information collected from this sampling programme shall be reported to ICCAT each year, describing, at a minimum, the following by country of landing and quarter: species composition, landings by species, length composition, and weights. Biological samples suitable for determining life history should be collected as practicable. PART VI FINAL PROVISIONS Availability of data to SCRS and to national scientists 44. CPCs shall ensure that: a) Both paper and electronic fishing logbooks referred to in paragraph 34 and the FAD -logbooks referred to in paragraph 21, where applicable, are promptly collected and made available to national scientists; b) The Task II data include the information collected from the fishing or FAD logbooks, where applicable, and is submitted every year to the ICCAT Executive Secretary, to be made available to the SCRS. 45. CPCs should encourage their national scientists to undertake collaborative work with their national industry to analyse data related to FADs (e.g. logbooks, buoy data) and to present the outcomes of that analysis to the SCRS. CPCs should take steps to facilitate making the data available for such collaborative work, subject to relevant confidentiality constraints. 46. With the objective of providing information useful to estimate the fishing effort related to FAD-fishing each CPC should provide to its national scientists full access to: (a) VMS data of their fishing and support vessels and trajectories of FADs; (b) Data recorded by echo-sounders; (c) FAD logbooks and the information collected pursuant to paragraph 23; 47. CPCs shall undertake historical data mining on the use and number of deployed FADs with a view to possibly submit the relevant information by 31 January 2017 to the ICCAT Executive Secretary, who shall make them available to the Ad Hoc Working Group on FADs and to the SCRS. SCRS activity and stock assessment 48. The SCRS shall conduct the next stock assessment of bigeye in 2018. 49. At its 2017 meeting the SCRS shall: (a) address to the extent possible the Recommendations made by the FAD Working Group in 2016 (Annex 8) and for the remaining ones develop a work plan to be presented to the Commission at its 2017 Annual meeting; (b) provide performance indicators for skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin tuna as specified in Annex 9, with the perspective to develop management strategy evaluations for tropical tunas; 11 (c) develop a table for consideration by the Commission that quantifies the expected impact on MSY, BMSY, and relative stock status for both bigeye and yellowfin resulting from reductions of the individual proportional contributions of longline, FAD purse seine, free school purse seine, and baitboat fisheries to the total catch. Confidentiality 50. All data submitted in accordance with this Recommendation shall be treated in a manner consistent with ICCAT’s data confidentiality guidelines and solely for the purposes of this Recommendation and in accordance with the requirements and procedures developed by the Commission. Fishing management plans 51. The Commission shall establish at its 2018 meeting conservation and management measures on the basis of the SCRS advice resulting from the new stock assessment on bigeye as well as the Resolution by ICCAT on Criteria for the Allocation of Fishing Possibilities [Res. 15-13]. In support of this effort, the Commission shall consider development/management plans of coastal developing CPCs and fishing/management plans of other CPCs submitted in 2017, so that adjustments can be made to the existing catch and capacity limits and other conservation measures in 2018, as appropriate. Those plans shall include comprehensive information about how the CPC manages capacity in the bigeye fishery. Each CPC shall submit to the Executive Secretary its 2018 development or fishing/management plan by 15 September 2017, in accordance with a template to be provided by the ICCAT Secretariat. Reduction of discards 52. CPCs shall: - submit to the SCRS information on by-catches and discards made by fishing vessels flying their flag fishing for tropical tunas; - encourage the vessel owners, masters and crew fishing for tropical tunas under their flag to implement good practices to better manage by-catches and reduce discards; - consider designing and adopting management measures and/or management plans to better manage by-catch and reduce discards. 53. The SCRS shall: - evaluate the contribution of by -catches and discards to the overall catches in ICCAT tropical tuna fisheries, on a fishery by fishery basis; - advise the Commission on possible measures allowing to reduce discards and to mitigate onboard post-harvest losses and by-catch in ICCAT tropical tuna fisheries. 54. When revising this Recommendation, the Commission shall consider the adoption of possible provisions for a better management of by -catches and reduction of discards in ICCAT tropical tuna fisheries. Repeals and review 55. This Recommendation replaces Rec. [15-01] and shall be revised as appropriate. 12 Annex 1 Requirements for Catch Recording Minimum specification for paper or electronic logbooks: 1. The logbook must be numbered by sheets 2.

Applicable period for the FAD Management Plan 5. Means for monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the FAD Management Plan Annex 7 Guidelines for reducing the ecological impact of FADs in ICCAT fisheries 1) The surface structure of the FAD should not be covered or only covered with material implying minimum risk of entangling by-catch species. 2) The sub-surface components should be exclusively composed of non -entangling material (e.g. ropes or canvas). 3) When designing FADs the use of biodegradable materials should be prioritised. 20 Annex 8 Activities to be included in the work plan to be developed by SCRS 1. Review the available information on fishing capacity and provide advice on adapting the fishing capacity in all its components (number of FADs, number of fishing vessels and support vessels) to achieve the management objectives for tropical tuna species. 2. By taking into account as baseline the outputs of the EU CECOFAD research project (SCRS/2016/30) the SCRS shall: (a) develop a set of definitions for floating objects and types of activities developed on them including “FAD sets” and “FAD fishing”. In particular, definitions and characteristics of non -entangling and bio-degradable FADs should be established; (b) review and recommend additional changes, as appropriate, to the minimum standard reporting requirements on data to be collected in FAD fisheries through logbooks; (c) establish guidelines addressed to vessel masters detailing how data and more particularly qualitative information would have to be reported. 3. Develop fisheries indicators describing catch compositions, size structures and catch average sizes of the different metiers contributing to the tropical tunas' fishing mortality and in particular of purse seine fleets fishing on floating objects. 4. Provide advice on possible modifications of fishing patterns affecting the catch -at-size composition and their impact on MSY and relative stock status. 5. In collaboration with the Secretariat, provide advice to establish a consolidated database of records of FAD activity across all purse seine fleets. 21 Annex 9 Indicative Performance indicators to support decision-making Performance metrics and associated statistics Unit of measurement Type of statistics 1.

This indicator is only useful to distinguish the performance of strategies which fulfil the objective represented by 1.4. 3. This differs slightly from being equal to 1 - Probability of a shutdown (4.3), because of the choice of having a management cycle of three years. In the next management cycle after B has been determined to be less than Blim the TAC is fixed during three years to t he level corresponding to Flim, and the catch will stay at such minimum level for three years. The biomass, however, may react quickly to the lowering of F and increase rapidly so that one or more of the three years of the cycle will have B>Blim. 4. Useful in the absence of TAC-related constraints in the harvest control rule. 5. Positive and negative changes to be reported separately. 6.

An ad hoc Working Group is established with the following Terms of Reference: a) Consider ways to reduce juvenile catches of bigeye and yellowfin tuna caught in FADs fishing; b) Assess the use of FADs in tropical tuna fisheries in ICCAT, including by estimating the past and current number of and different types of buoys and FADs operating in ICCAT tropical tuna fisheries, and evaluate ways to improve the use of information related to FADs in the process of stock assessments, including to quantify the effort associated with this type of fishery; c) In view of the identification of data gaps, review the information provided by CPCs pursuant to the FAD related provisions in the relevant ICCAT conservation and management measures; d) Based on the best available information, examine: i. the fishing capacity for all components of ICCAT tropical tuna fisheries, including the relative contribution of FAD fishing to overall fishing mortality by age or size category; ii. assessed and projected changes, in bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack Biomass and MSY estimates, associated to different selectivity patterns and juveniles fishing mortality levels. 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 16-01, 19-02, 21-01, 22-01, and 24-01. 23 e) Assess the developments in FAD-related technology, including with regard to: − Technological improvement in relation to fishing mortality. − FAD and buoys marking and identification as a tool for monitoring, tracking and control of FADs. − Reducing FADs' ecological impact through improved design, such as non -entangling FADs and biodegradable material. f) Identify management options and common standards for FAD management, including the regulation of: 1) FAD sets; 2) deployment limits of FADs and buoys (by distinguishing total number of deployed buoys and the number of active ones); 3) characteristics of FADs, such as marking; 4) activities of purse seiners, baitboats and support vessels, in particular the link established in fishing operations between support vessels and individual fishing vessels, and evaluate their effect on ICCAT managed species and on t he pelagic eco-systems, based on scientific advice and the precautionary approach. This should take into consideration all the fishing mortality components, the methods by which FAD fishing has increased a vessel's ability to catch fish, as well as socio -economic elements with the view to provide effective recommendations to the Commission for FAD management in tropical tuna fisheries. g) Identify and assess options for and timing of recovery of FADs and/or mitigating FAD losses in order to ensure a proper management of their potential impact on different coastal ad high-sea components of the marine environment. h) Evaluate progress made based on the recommendations issued by the Working Group in 2016 and thereafter as appropriate. 2. The third meeting of this ad hoc Working Group shall take place in 2017 and thereafter as appropriate. 3. The ad hoc Working Group shall report on its work with a view to recommend the adoption of appropriate measures at the relevant ICCAT Commission meeting. 4. The ICCAT Commission, at its annual meetings, will review the progress and outcomes of the ad hoc Working Group, identify priority tasks, and assess future needs. 5. The ad hoc Working Group will be chaired by the Chair of Panel 1 and the Chair of the SCRS. The Chairs of the ad hoc Working Group should coordinate to establish procedures to ensure a full and open exchange among all participants. 6. The structure of the meetings will include an open forum/dialogue among scientists, fisheries managers, industry representatives and other interested stakeholders. Recommendations to the Commission shall be developed through sessions of the ad hoc Working Group, which should ensure a balanced presence and active participation of scientists and managers. 7. The ICCAT Secretariat will work with the Secretariats of other tuna RFMOs in which FAD Working Groups have been established to promote the cooperation between these groups, including through the organization of a joint session in 2017 with the interested tuna RFMOs. 8. This Recommendation repeals and replaces [Rec. 15-02]. 24 17-01 TRO RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON PROHIBITION ON DISCARDS OF TROPICAL TUNAS CAUGHT BY PURSE SEINERS (Entry into force 11 June 2018) RECALLING the FAO International Guidelines on by -catch management and reduction of discards that aim to facilitate by -catch management and reduction of discards, in accordance with the FAO Code of Conduct for responsible fishing; NOTING that the Recommendation by ICCAT on a multi -annual conservation and management programme for tropical tunas [Rec. 16 -01]1 established a multi -annual conservation and management programme for tropical tunas in the ICCAT Convention area; RECOGNISING that Recommendation 16-01 envisages the adoption of provisions for better by-catch management and reduction of discards in the ICCAT tropical tuna fisheries; RECALLING that the second meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group on FADs recommended development of an appropriate retention policy for tropical tunas to better manage by -catch and reduce discards in tropical tuna fisheries, in accordance with the FAO guidelines; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the recommendations made by the SCRS in 2017 on tropical tunas; RECOGNISING that other tuna RFMOs have implemented similar conservation and management measures requiring purse seiners to implement full retention of tunas; CONCERNED by the loss of data due to discards of tuna and other species in the ICCAT tropical tuna fisheries; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the considerable volume of tunas caught in the purse seine fishery targeting tropical tunas in the Atlantic Ocean; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Objective The objective of this recommendation is to achieve a substantial reduction in discards of tropical tunas by 2020. Retention of tuna species 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating Non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) whose purse seiners are authorised to fish for bigeye and/or yellowfin and/or skipjack tuna in the Convention area, pursuant to paragraph 25 of Recommendation 16-01, must require these vessels to retain on board then land or tranship to port all bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tunas caught, except in the cases described in paragraph 2b. 2. The procedures for implementation of full retention requirements comprise: a) No bigeye, skipjack and/or yellowfin tuna caught by a purse seiner may be discarded during the set once the net is completely closed and when more than half of the net has been retrieved. If there is a technical problem with the closing or retrieval proced ure of the net such that this rule cannot be applied, the crew shall make every effort to release the tunas into the water as quickly as possible. 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 19-02, 21-01, 22-01, and 24-01. 25 b) The following two exceptions apply to this rule: i. When the vessel master determines that the tunas caught (bigeye, skipjack or yellowfin tuna) are not fit for human consumption, the following definitions shall apply: - “unfit for human consumption” refers to fish that: • are meshed or crushed in the purse seine net; or • are damaged due to depredation; or • have died and decomposed in the net due to a gear failure that has prevented the normal activities of retrieval of the net and fishing and efforts to release the fish alive; - “unfit for human consumption” does not include fish that: • are considered undesirable in terms of size, marketability, or species composition; or • have decomposed or are contaminated as a result of an act or omission of the crew of the fishing vessel. ii. When the vessel master determines that the tunas (bigeye, skipjack or yellowfin tuna) have been caught during the last set of a trip and there is not enough storage capacity to store the tunas (bigeye, skipjack or yellowfin tuna) caught during this set, these fish may only be discarded if: - the master or the crew attempt to release the tuna alive (bigeye, skipjack or yellowfin tuna) as quickly as possible; and - no other fishing operation is conducted following the discarding, until such time as the tunas (bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tuna) onboard the vessel are landed or transhipped. The CPC shall report all discards observed. 3. CPCs shall encourage their vessels using other gear types (i.e., longline, baitboat and gillnets) to retain onboard and land or, to the extent possible and in compliance with Recommendation 16 -152, tranship at port all bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna caught except in the cases where ICCAT measures in force or national regulations prohibit their retention or encourage their release. Implementation and review 4. In 2020, the SCRS shall assess the effectiveness of this Recommendation and submit recommendations to the Commission regarding potential improvements. 5. In 2020, the SCRS shall also undertake work to examine the benefits according to the objectives defined above of retaining non-targeted species catches and present its recommendations to the Commission. The work should take into account all species that are usually discarded on all major gears (i.e., purse-seines, longlines and gillnets), and should look at fisheries that take place both on the high seas and in waters under national jurisdiction and the feasibility of both retaining on-board and processing of the associated landings. 2 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 21-15 and 24-15. 26 24-01 TRO RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT REPLACING RECOMMENDATION 22-01 ON A MULTI-ANNUAL CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME FOR TROPICAL TUNAS (Entry into force 16 June 2025) RECALLING the current multi-annual conservation and management programme for tropical tunas; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that the Recommendation by ICCAT on the principles of decision making for ICCAT conservation and management measures (Rec. 11-13) establishes that for stocks that are overfished and not subject to overfishing (i.e. stocks in the lower left yellow quadrant of the Kobe diagram) the Commission shall adopt management measures designed to rebuild these stocks in as short period possible, taking into account, inter alia, the biology of the stock and Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) advice; TAKING FURTHER INTO ACCOUNT that it is advisable to continue exploring alternative and more effective systems or regimes for the management of tropical tunas and for this the SCRS’ recommendation is required; NOTING that the stock assessment for bigeye tuna (BET) in 2021 indicated that the stock is overfished but no longer subject to overfishing; RECALLING the successive reductions of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for bigeye tuna from 85,000 t to 62,000 t and their detrimental socio-economic impacts; CONSIDERING that the Committee has recommended that effective measures be found to reduce fishing mortality of small yellowfin and bigeye tuna; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the recommendations made by the Panel on the Second ICCAT Performance Review regarding the carryover of underage of catches from one year to another; FURTHER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the recommendations made by the First Meeting of the Joint Tuna RFMO FAD Working Group and the Third Meeting of ICCAT Ad Hoc Working Group on FADs, on FAD management objectives and the availability of FAD management measures to reduce juvenile tuna mortality; NOTING that the SCRS has advised that increased harvests on FADs as well as other fisheries as well as development of new fisheries could have had negative consequences for the productivity of bigeye and yellowfin tuna fisheries (e.g. reduced yield at MSY); FURTHER NOTING that support vessels contribute to the increase in efficiency and capacity of purse seine vessels using FADs and that the number of support vessels has increased over the years; RECALLING the provisions of Resolution by ICCAT on criteria for the allocation of fishing possibilities (Res. 15-13); FURTHER RECALLING the significant body of international law that recognizes the rights and special requirements of developing States, including but not limited to, as applicable, Article 119 of UNCLOS and Article 24 and Part VII of UNFSA; RECOGNISING the particular interests of developing coastal States to develop their fishing opportunities, and committing to achieve a more equitable distribution of fishing opportunities to developing coastal States over time; FURTHER RECOGNIZING the importance and role of small -scale, artisanal, and subsistence fishers as well as the Global Action Plan of the International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture 2022; 27 TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that any increase of fishing capacity should remain commensurate with fishing opportunities to achieve sustainable productive fisheries, while allowing developing coastal States to develop their fishing capacity to take advantage of new fishing opportunities; EMPHASIZING the importance of preventing an uncontrolled increase of the fishing capacity, and in particular the necessity to control the transfer of capacity from other oceans to the Atlantic; ALSO CONSIDERING that catch limits previously allocated to some CPCs shall not be considered acquired rights; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: PART I GENERAL PROVISIONS Conservation and management measures 1. Without prejudice to the allocation of fishing rights and opportunities to be adopted in the future, for the years 2025, 2026 and 2027, the Contracting Parties and the Cooperating Non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as CPCs) shall apply the following conservation and management measures with the objective of managing fishing mortality of tropical tunas, including small bigeye and yellowfin. Multi-annual Management, Rebuilding and Conservation Programme 2. CPCs shall continue to implement a 15-year rebuilding programme for bigeye tuna started in 2020 and continuing through 2034, with the goal of achieving B MSY with a probability of more than 50%. CPCs shall also implement conservation and management measures with the objective of ensuring that the stocks of yellowfin and skipjack tuna are exploited sustainably. PART II CATCH LIMITS Total Allowable Catch and Harvest Control Rule for bigeye tuna 3. The annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for bigeye tuna shall be set at 73,011 t for 2025. This TAC level shall be continued for 2026 and 2027 if the stock assessment to be conducted in 2025 indicates that the probability of the stock being in the green zon e in 2034 in K2SM (hereinafter called “the probability”) is at or more than 65%. If the probability is less than 65%, the Commission shall adopt a TAC with a probability that is at or more than 65%. If the probability of a 2026 TAC of 73,011 t is more than 70%, the Commission shall consider possible increases to the TAC provided that the probability is at least 70%. 4. The Commission recognizes that the 65% and 70% probabilities are interim figures for establishing the TAC for 2025, 2026 and 2027 and are higher compared to the percentages typically used for other ICCAT stocks. These percentages do not set a precedent for future discussions of the Commission. These percentages shall only be used if the 2025 assessment exceptionally so determines, in application of paragraph 3 above. 5. Notwithstanding the above, paragraphs 3 and 4 shall cease to apply when the Commission establishes a management procedure (MP) based on a tropical tuna management strategy evaluation (MSE). Catch limits for bigeye tuna and conditions associated with the catch limits 6. As an interim measure, the following catch limits for bigeye tuna shall apply for 2025, 2026 and 2027, unless a change in TAC is adopted pursuant to paragraph 3: 28 CPC Category1 Catch limits (t) EU A 13,576.29 Japan 13,865.86 Chinese Taipei 9,151.19 China (P.R.) 4,624.07 Korea 1,100.00 Brazil B 6,825.37 Ghana 4,445.85 Senegal 2,546.01 Curaçao 2,810.00 Panama 2,430.00 El Salvador 1,980.00 Belize 1,956.33 Morocco 1,600.00 Small harvesters C 6,100.00 7. In implementing the bigeye catch limits in paragraph 6, the following provisions shall apply: a) The Sub-total for Category C is not a limit. b) CPCs in Category C shall be subject to a 1,575 t trigger threshold. If the annual catches of bigeye tuna by a CPC in Category C exceeds this threshold in two consecutive years from 2025, Panel 1 shall determine a binding catch limit to apply to that CPC in future years. c) CPCs in Category C shall not be subject to any underharvest, carry -over or payback provisions, and shall not be eligible to engage in transfers of fishing opportunities pursuant to Recommendation by ICCAT regarding the temporary adjustment of quotas (Rec. 01 -12). The provisions on chartering in the Recommendation by ICCAT on vessel chartering (Rec. 13 -14) remain unaffected as a mechanism for the development of CPC fisheries in this Category. d) If the combined bigeye tuna catches of all CPCs within Category C exceed the sub -total for Category C in any given year, Panel 1 shall reconsider the arrangement, including the need to assign catch limits to individual CPCs within Category C. e) If the TAC in 2026 is decreased in accordance with paragraph 3, the reserve for Category C shall remain unchanged. f) If a CPC in Categories A or B underharvests its total catch limit (as adjusted to account for over or under harvests but excluding quota transfers) in any year, it may carry-forward into the next year or the year following that, a maximum of 10% of its initial catch limit specified in paragraph 6. g) If the TAC in 2026 is increased in accordance with paragraph 3, at least 20% of the increase in the TAC shall be allocated to Category C. 8. The provisions of paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Recommendation shall not prejudice the rights and obligations under international law of those developing coastal CPCs in the Convention area whose current fishing activity for bigeye tuna is limited or non-existent, but that have a real interest in fishing for the species, and that may wish to develop their own fisheries targeting bigeye tuna in the future. CPCs shall implement robust monitoring, control and surveillance measures, as applicable in relation to their capacity and resources. Any limitations that may result from this Recommendation for those CPCs shall be considered interim for the duration of this Recommendation, without prejudice to its reviews and amendments. 1 For the purpose of this Recommendation, the category does not reflect any CPC's economic development level. 29 9. Small-scale fisheries, including those operating in overseas territories and outermost regions of a CPC, shall be given special consideration to their specificities and needs. 10. The annual catch limits described in this Recommendation do not constitute long-term rights and are without prejudice to any future process of allocation. 11. If the total catch in any year exceeds the annual TAC specified in paragraph 3, adjusted by the carryover of underharvests, when applicable, due to causes other than exceeding of catch limits by a CPC with an allocated catch limit, the Commission shall review these measures. 12. Korea may transfer up to 223 t of its bigeye tuna fishing possibilities to Chinese Taipei annually from 2025 to 2027. Japan will make an annual transfer of 350 t of its bigeye catch limit to China from 2025 to 2027. Excess with respect to bigeye tuna catch limits 13. Any overharvest of its total annual catch limit of bigeye tuna for CPCs listed in paragraph 6 shall be deducted from that CPC's catch limit on or before the adjustment year as follows: Year of catch Adjustment year 2025 2027 2026 2028 2027 2029 14. Taking into account paragraph 13, if any CPC exceeds its annual catch limit: a) In one year, then the amount deducted on or before the adjustment year shall be determined as 100% of the overage; and b) During any two consecutive years, the Commission shall recommend appropriate measures, which shall include reduction in the catch limit equal to 125% of the accumulated excess harvest. Monitoring of catch 15. CPCs shall report quarterly to the ICCAT Secretariat the amount of tropical tunas by species caught by vessels flying their flag, within 30 days of the end of the period during which the catches were made. 16. Notwithstanding paragraph 15, for purse seiners and large longline vessels (LOA 20m or greater), CPCs shall report on a monthly basis, increasing to weekly when 80% of their bigeye tuna catch limits have been caught. 17. The ICCAT Secretariat shall notify all CPCs once 80% of the bigeye TAC has been caught. 18. CPCs shall report to the ICCAT Secretariat the dates when their entire catch limit of bigeye tuna has been utilized. The ICCAT Secretariat shall promptly circulate this information to all CPCs and shall keep it published and updated on the ICCAT website. TAC for yellowfin tuna 19. The annual TAC for 2025 and subsequent years of the Multi -annual Programme is 110,000 t for yellowfin tuna and shall remain in place until changed based on scientific advice. 20. Based on the stock assessment and SCRS advice, the Commission shall adopt additional conservation measures for yellowfin tuna at the 2027 Annual Meeting, which may include a revised TAC, closures or allocated catch limits. 30 21. If the total catch exceeds in any year the TAC in paragraph 19, the Commission shall consider additional management measures for yellowfin tuna. Any other measures shall take into account the special requirements of developing coastal CPCs. 22. The ICCAT Secretariat shall notify all CPCs once 80% of the yellowfin TAC has been caught. Fishing, management and capacity plans 23. By 15 February each year, CPCs in Category A and B, as specified in paragraph 6, shall submit a fishing, management and capacity plan to Panel 1 on how they will implement their respective catch limit obligations. The plan shall include the current number of fishing vessels by gear and by size (< 20 m or ≧ 20 m) and support vessels. 24. Each CPC shall demonstrate in the plan that its total capacity is commensurate with its catch limit, taking into account the annual average bigeye catches per vessel in the past and other factors such as dependence of each vessel on bigeye catch. For infor mation purposes, Panel 1 shall annually review these plans. 25. Notwithstanding paragraph 23, if a CPC in Category C catches more than 500 t of bigeye tuna in any year, it shall submit a fishing, management and capacity plan to Panel 1 within two years following the year the catch was made. The plan shall include the c urrent number of fishing vessels by gear and by size (< 20 m or ≧ 20 m) as well as any plan to introduce additional fishing vessels in the current or following year. The plans shall be submitted to Panel 1 for information. 26. Any CPCs in Category C that plan to expand capacity in 2025, 2026 or 2027, shall provide a declaration by the 31 January of that year. These declarations should include details of proposed/potential fleet additions, including vessel characteristics and gea r type. The declarations shall be submitted to the ICCAT Secretariat and be made available to all CPCs. Those CPCs shall amend their declaration as their situation and opportunities change. PART III CAPACITY MANAGEMENT MEASURES ON FISHING AND SUPPORT VESSELS 27. Any CPC having vessels that operate, part-time or full-time, in support of purse seiners shall report the names and characteristics of all of their vessels to the ICCAT Secretariat, including which of those vessels were active in 2019 in the ICCAT Conventi on area, and the names of the purse seiner(s) that received the support of each support vessel. The ICCAT Secretariat shall compile this information and prepare a report for the Commission to be able to consider the type of limitation that support vessels shall be subject to in the future, including a phasing -out plan, where required. Notwithstanding this, CPCs shall not increase the number of support vessels from the number active in 2019; this does not apply to the new participants in purse seine fisherie s, for which a maximum proportion of support vessels can be defined in 2025 based on an SCRS recommendation. 28. For the purposes of this measure, a support vessel is defined as any vessel that carries out activities in support of purse seine vessels that increases the efficiency of their operations including, but not limited to deploying, servicing and retrieving FADs. PART IV MANAGEMENT OF FADS FAD management objectives 29. The general objectives for management of FADs and support vessels in the Convention area are defined as follows: a) To minimize potential impacts that high FAD density may have on purse seine fishing efficiency, while minimizing disproportionate impacts to the fishing opportunities of fleets that use other gear or other fishing strategies while also targeting tropical tunas; 31 b) To minimize the impact of FAD fishing on the productivity of bigeye and yellowfin stocks that results from the capture of high numbers of juveniles that aggregate with skipjack on FADs; c) To minimize the impact of FAD fishing on non -target species, where appropriate, including entanglement of marine species, particularly those of conservation concern; d) To minimize the impact of FADs and FAD fishing on pelagic and coastal ecosystems, including by preventing the beaching, stranding or grounding of FADs in sensitive habitats or the alteration of pelagic habitat. 30. For the purpose of this Recommendation, the following definitions shall apply: i. Floating object (FOB): Any natural or artificial floating (i.e. surface or subsurface) object with no capability of moving on its own. FADs are those FOBs that are man -made and intentionally deployed and/or tracked. Logs are those FOBs that are accidentall y lost from anthropic and natural sources. ii. Fish Aggregating Device (FAD): Permanent, semi -permanent or temporary object, structure or device of any material, man -made or natural, which is deployed and/or tracked, and used to aggregate fish for subsequent capture. FADs can either be anchored (aFADs) or drifting (dFADs). iii. FAD set: Setting a fishing gear around a tuna school associated with a FAD. iv. Operational buoy: Any instrumented buoy, previously activated, switched on and deployed at sea, which transmits position and any other available information such as eco-sounder estimates. v. Activation: The act of enabling satellite communication services by the buoy supplier company at the request of the buoy owner. The owner then starts paying fees for communication services. The buoy can be transmitting or not, depending if it has been manually switched on. vi. Biodegradable: Non-synthetic material2 and/or bio- based alternatives that are consistent with international standards 3 for materials that are biodegradable in marine environments. The components resulting from the degradation of these materials should not be damaging to the marine and coastal ecosystems or include heavy metals or plastics in their composition. vii. Non-entangling FAD: A FAD that does not include any netting materials for any part of the FAD including both the surface structure (e.g. raft) and subsurface structure (e.g. tail). FAD closure 31. In order to reduce the fishing mortality of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tunas, fishing for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas by purse seine and baitboat vessels in association with FADs, and activity by vessels supporting such vessels shall be prohibited during a 45 day-period in 2025 from 17 March to 30 April, throughout the Convention area. In 2025, the SCRS shall estimate the expected effects of the measures in this and previous Recommendations, in particular, the possible effects of increasing catch limits of CPCs with purse seiners in terms of change in bigeye juvenile mortality, based on the new bigeye stock assessment, and revise the K2SM. The Commission shall consider, as appropriate, based on the SCRS’ work, whether to modify the FAD closure pe riod or establish additional measures at its 2025 Regular Meeting. If the Commission cannot agree to any additional measures in 2025, a FAD closure period of at least the same length shall remain in place for 2026 and 2027. 32. In addition, each CPC shall ensure its vessels do not deploy drifting FADs during a period of 15 days prior to the start of the closure period. 2 For example, plant -based materials such as cotton, jute, manila hemp (abaca), bamboo, natural rubber, or animal -based such as leather, wool, lard. 3 International standards such as ASTM D6691, D7881, TUV Austria, European or any such standards approved by ICCAT. 32 FAD limitations 33. CPCs shall ensure that, for vessels flying their flag, the following limits shall apply on the number of FADs with operational buoys at any one time according to definitions given in paragraph 30. The number of FADs with operational buoys shall be verified through the verification of telecommunication bills. Such verifications shall be conducted by the competent authorities of the CPCs: - 2025: 300 FADs per vessel - 2026 and 2027: 288 FADs per vessel. 34. With a view to analyzing the establishment of FAD set limits to keep the catches of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin at sustainable levels, national scientists from CPCs with purse seine vessels shall submit analyses of the per fleet catch rates of bigeye and yellowfin on FADs from 2019 to 2023 and present these to the SCRS for their evaluation in 2025. Also, CPCs with purse seine vessels shall report to the SCRS by 15 July 2025 the required available historical FAD set data in the format required by the SCRS (Task 2 catch and effort through Form ST03-T2CE) for a minimum of the last five years (2019 -2023). For those CPCs who have provided the historical FAD set data, the data of the latest year shall be provided. CPCs that do not report these data in accordance with this paragraph shall be automatically and immediately prohibited from setting on FADs until such data have been received by the Secretariat. By 1 August 2025, the Secretariat shall provide a report to the Commission on the data received, including a notification of any CPCs that have not provided the required data and are prohibited from setting on FADs. When any CPC subject to such prohibition rectifies the situation by submitting its data to the Secretariat for transmission to the SCRS, the Secretar iat shall, without delay, so notify the Commission. In 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter, the SCRS should provide advice to the Commission on the maximum number of FAD sets per vessel or per CPC in the Convention area. To this purpose, the advice from the SCRS shall describe the data set used, the meth odology, as well as the objectives set within the context of all tropical tuna fisheries. Nothing in this provision shall be construed as an amendment to the data provision standards applicable in ICCAT. SCRS shall evaluate and advise to the Commission on any change in the data provision standards to be required of all fleets fishing for tropical tunas. The information provided under this paragraph can only be utilized for the specific purposes expressed herein. In addition, each CPC with purse seine fishing vessels is encouraged not to increase its total fishing effort on FADs from its 2018 level. CPCs shall report the difference between the 2018 level and the 2024 level to the Commission at the 2025 Annual Meeting. 35. CPCs may authorize their purse seine vessels to set on floating objects provided that the fishing vessel has either an observer or a functioning electronic monitoring system on board which is consistent with the Recommendation by ICCAT to establish minimum standards and programme requirements for the use of Electronic Monitoring Systems (EMS) in ICCAT fisheries (Rec. 23-18) and shall provide to the SCRS information on fishing activities specified in the Recommendation by ICCAT to establish minimum standards for fishing vessel scientific observer program (Rec. 16-14) and Rec. 23-18. Each year, by 15 July, CPCs shall notify the Secretariat which of their purse seine vessels that set on floating objects in the previous year complied with the provisions of this paragraph. The Secretariat shall provide a summary of the verifications mad e by the CPCs, to the Compliance Committee for analyses and recommendations 30 days ahead of the annual meeting. 36. Further analysis shall be conducted by the SCRS on the effect of support vessels on the catches of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna to be considered in 2025. FAD management plans 37. CPCs with purse seine and/or baitboat vessels fishing for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas in association with FADs, shall submit to the Executive Secretary management plans for the use of aggregating devices by vessels flying their flag by 15 February each year. 33 38. The objective of the FAD management plans shall be the following: i. improve the knowledge about FAD characteristics, buoy characteristics, FAD fishing, including fishing effort of purse seiners and associated support vessels, and related impacts on target and non-target species; ii. effectively manage the deployment and recovery of FADs, the activation of buoys and their potential loss; iii. reduce and limit the impacts of FADs and FAD fishing on the ecosystem, including, where appropriate, by acting on the different components of the fishing mortality (e.g. number of deployed FADs, including number of FADs set by purse seiners, fishing capaci ty, number of support vessels). 39. The plans shall be drawn up by following the Guidelines for Preparation of FAD Management Plans as provided in Annex 1. FAD logbook and list of deployed FADs 40. CPCs shall ensure that all purse seine and baitboat fishing vessels and all support vessels (including supply vessels) flying their flag, and/or authorized by CPCs to fish in areas under their jurisdiction, when fishing in association with or deploying FADs, collect and report, for each deployment of a FAD, each visit on a FAD, whether followed or not by a set, or each loss of a FAD, the following information and data: a) Deployment of any FAD i. Position ii. Date iii. FAD type (anchored FAD, drifting artificial FAD) iv. FAD identifier (i.e. FAD marking and buoy ID, type of buoy e.g. simple buoy or associated with echo-sounder) v. FAD design characteristics (material of the floating part and of the underwater hanging structure and the entangling or non-entangling feature of the underwater hanging structure) b) Visit on any FAD i. Type of the visit (deployment of a FAD and/or buoy 4, retrieving FAD and/or buoy, strengthening/consolidation of FAD, intervention on electronic equipment, random encounter (without fishing) of a log or a FAD belonging to another vessel, visit (without fishing) of a FAD belonging to the vessel, fishing set on a FAD5) ii. Position iii. Date iv. FAD type (anchored FAD, drifting natural FAD, drifting artificial FAD) v. Log description or FAD identifier (i.e. FAD marking and buoy ID or any information allowing to identify the owner) vi. Buoy ID vii. If the visit is followed by a set, the results of the set in terms of catch and bycatch, whether retained or discarded dead or alive. If the visit is not followed by a set, note the reason (e.g. not enough fish, fish too small, etc.) c) Loss of any FAD i. Last registered position ii. Date of the last registered position iii. FAD identifier (i.e. FAD marking and buoy ID) For the purpose of the collection and reporting of the information referred to above and where paper or electronic logbooks already in place do not allow it, CPCs shall either update their reporting system or establish FAD logbooks. In establishing FAD logbooks, CPCs should consider using the template laid down in Annex 2 as reporting format. When using paper logbooks, CPCs may seek, with the support of the Executive Secretary, harmonized formats. In both cases, CPCs shall use the minimum standards recommended by the SCRS in Annex 3. 4 Deploying a buoy on a FAD includes three aspects: deploying a buoy on a foreign FAD, transferring a buoy (which changes the F AD's owner) and changing the buoy on the same FAD (which does not change the FADs owner). 5 A fishing set on a FAD includes two aspects: fishing after a visit to a vessel’s own FAD (targeted) or fishing after a random encounter with a FAD (opportunistic). 34 41. CPCs shall also ensure that all vessels referred to in paragraph 33 keep updated on a monthly basis and per 1°x1° statistical rectangles a list of deployed FADs and buoys, containing at least the information as laid down in Annex 4. 42. The IMM Working Group and SCRS shall review the requirements of paragraphs 39, 40 and 41 and make recommendations to remove duplication and streamline FAD data and reporting obligations, in light of any future FAD registry and associated technology change. Reporting obligations on FADs and on support vessels 43. CPCs shall ensure that the following information is submitted every year to the Executive Secretary in a format provided by the ICCAT Secretariat. This information shall be made available to the SCRS and to the Ad Hoc Working Group on FADs in a database developed by the ICCAT Secretariat: i. the number of FADs actually deployed on a monthly basis per 1°x1° statistical rectangles, by FAD type, indicating the presence or absence of a beacon/buoy or of an echo -sounder associated to the FAD and specifying the number of FADs deployed by associated support vessels, irrespective of their flag; ii. the number and type of beacons/buoys (e.g. radio, sonar only, sonar with echo-sounder) deployed on a monthly basis per 1°x1° statistical rectangles; iii. the average numbers of beacons/buoys activated and deactivated on a monthly basis that have been followed by each vessel; iv. average numbers of lost FADs with active buoys on a monthly basis; v. for each support vessel, the number of days spent at sea, per 1° grid area, month and flag State; vi. purse seine and baitboat catches, efforts and number of sets (for purse seines) by fishing mode (floating-object associated schools and free school fisheries) in line with Task 2 data requirements (i.e. per 1°x1° statistical rectangles and per month); vii. when the activities of purse seine are carried out in association with baitboat, report catches and effort in line with Task 1 and Task 2 requirements as “purse seine associated to baitboats” (PS+BB). Non-entangling and biodegradable FADs 44. To reduce the entanglement of sharks, marine turtles or any other species, CPCs shall ensure that, as of 1 January 2025, the design and construction of any FADs to be deployed or redeployed (i.e. will be placed in the water) in the ICCAT Convention area sh all comply with the following specifications in accordance with Annex 5: a) the use of mesh net shall be prohibited for any part of a FAD; b) only non-entangling FAD materials and designs shall be used. 45. To reduce the amount of synthetic marine debris: a) CPCs shall only allow vessels to deploy or redeploy FADs of biodegradability Categories I, II and III, as defined in Annex 5; b) CPCs shall no longer deploy any FADs of Category IV, as defined in Annex 5; c) as of 1 January 2026, CPCs shall use only FADs of Categories I and II, as defined in Annex 5; and d) as of 1 January 2028, CPCs shall use only FADs of Category I, as defined in Annex 5. 46. Notwithstanding paragraph 45, the use of non-biodegradable materials, in particular nylon ropes, can be used exclusively to strengthen the structure of the floating or underwater component of the FAD Categories I and II, as a temporary solution and only provided no biodegradable alternative is available. 47. CPCs are encouraged to share their experiences and scientific knowledge on the use of biodegradable materials in drifting FADs. 48. CPCs shall collect and submit to ICCAT detailed information in their FAD management plans on the drifting FAD design used including its conformity with the requirements set out in Annex 5 prior to the deployment of each drifting FAD. 35 49. CPCs shall submit in their FAD management plans information concerning the status of implementation of paragraphs 44 and 45, and this information shall be made available for analysis to the SCRS and the IMM Working Group. 50. CPCs are encouraged to continue trialing biodegradable FAD (bioFAD) designs in a continued effort of design improvement and to share the results in the FAD management plan. The Secretariat shall make this available to the SCRS when provided. 51. The SCRS and the IMM Working Group shall review the information reported by CPCs and shall, as necessary, provide recommendations on additional drifting FAD management options for consideration by the Commission, including recommendations on improved drifting FAD designs. 52. The Commission shall consider appropriate assistance to developing CPCs for the full implementation of this Recommendation. PART V CONTROL MEASURES Specific authorization to fish for tropical tunas 53. CPCs shall issue specific authorizations to vessels 20 meters LOA or greater flying their flag allowed to fish bigeye and/or yellowfin and/or skipjack tunas in the Convention area, and to vessels flying their flag used for any kind of support of this fishing activity (hereafter referred to as "authorized vessels"). ICCAT Record of authorized tropical tuna vessels 54. The Commission shall establish and maintain an ICCAT record of authorized tropical tuna vessels, including support vessels. Tropical tuna vessels not entered into this record are deemed not to be authorized to fish, retain on board, tranship, transport, tr ansfer, process or land bigeye and/or yellowfin and/or skipjack tunas from the Convention area or to carry out any kind of support to those activities, including deploying and retrieving FADs and/or buoys. 55. Notwithstanding paragraph 54, a CPC may allow bycatch of tropical tunas by fishing vessels 20m LOA or greater not authorized to fish for tropical tunas pursuant to paragraph 53, if this CPC establishes a maximum per trip onboard bycatch limit of not more t han 5% by species for such vessels and the bycatch is accounted for within the CPC's quota or catch limit. Each CPC shall provide in its Annual Report: a) the maximum bycatch limit it allows for such vessels, b) the total amount of tropical tuna harvested as bycatch that year, c) information about how the CPC ensures compliance with the limit and d) the maximum per trip bycatch limit the CPC will allow per stock for the coming fishing year. The information in item d) above shall be compiled by the ICCAT Sec retariat and made available to CPCs by 15 January each year. 56. Conditions and procedures referred to in the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 13-13 concerning the establishment of an ICCAT Record of vessels 20 metres in length overall or greater authorized to operate in the Convention area (Rec. 21 -14) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the ICCAT Record of authorized tropical tuna vessels. 57. CPCs shall notify the list of authorized vessels to the Executive Secretary in an electronic form and in accordance with the format set in the Guidelines for Submitting Data and Information Required by ICCAT. For purse seine vessels, the notification shall include data on transport or fishing carrying capacity of the vessels in gross registered tonnage (GRT), or, where possible, Gross Tonnage (GT), aiming ICCAT to monitor the capacity of fleet activity in the Convention area. 58. The Executive Secretary shall, without delay, post the record of authorized vessels on the ICCAT website, including any additions, deletions and/or modifications so notified by CPCs. 59. The provisions of paragraphs 53 to 58 do not apply to recreational vessels. 36 Transhipments 60. Large-scale pelagic longline vessels (LSPLVs) shall be allowed to tranship at sea only in the presence of a Regional Observer onboard carrier vessels, in accordance with the Recommendation by ICCAT amending 21-15 on transshipment (Rec. 24-15). Recording of catch and fishing activities 61. Each CPC shall ensure that its vessels 20 meters LOA or greater fishing bigeye and/or yellowfin and/or skipjack tunas in the Convention area record their catch in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex 6 and in the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning the recording of catch by fishing vessels in the ICCAT Convention area (Rec. 03-13). Identification of IUU fishing activity 62. The Executive Secretary shall, without delay, verify that any vessel identified or reported in the context of this Multi-annual Programme is on the ICCAT Record of authorized vessels. If a possible violation is detected, the Executive Secretary shall, with out delay, notify the flag CPC. The flag CPC shall immediately investigate the situation and, if the vessel is fishing in relation to objects that could affect fish aggregation, including FADs, during the period of closure, request the vessel to stop fishing and, if necessary, leave the area. The flag CPC shall, without delay, report to the Executive Secretary the results of its investigation and the corresponding measures taken. 63. The Executive Secretary shall report to the Compliance Committee at each annual meeting of the Commission on any issue related to identification of unauthorized vessels, the implementation of the VMS, the observer provisions, and the results of the relevant investigation made as well as any relevant measures taken by the flag CPCs concerned. 64. The Executive Secretary shall propose to include any vessels identified in accordance with paragraph 62, or vessels for which the flag CPC has not carried out the required investigation and taken, if necessary, adequate measures in accordance with paragraph 62, on the draft ICCAT IUU vessel list. Observers 65. Observers shall perform tasks to verify compliance with the conservation and management measures adopted by ICCAT and carry out the scientific data collection and tasks required by the SCRS. While on board vessels targeting bigeye, yellowfin and/or skipjack tunas in the area East of meridian 20°/West longitude and North of parallel 28°/ South latitude in the Convention area, the following shall apply: - Observers shall automatically be recognized by all CPCs. Such recognition shall allow the observer to continue the collection of information throughout the EEZ visited by the vessel observed. The coastal CPCs concerned shall receive from the Flag CPC which mandated the observer the information collected by the observer and related to fishing activities on ICCAT species in their EEZ. 66. In 2025, 2026, and 2027 CPCs shall ensure a minimum of 10% observer coverage on their longline vessels of 20m LOA or greater targeting bigeye, yellowfin and/or skipjack in the Convention Area. This shall be achieved through the presence of a human observer on board in accordance with Annex 7 or a combination of human observers and EMS consistent with Rec. 16-14, unless a derogation as outlined in that measure applies and EMS can be used to cover the required minimum percentage of human observers as advised by the SCRS. CPCs shall report the information collected by the observers or by a combination of observers and EMS from the previous year in accordance with Rec. 23 -18 and Rec. 16-14 to the ICCAT Secretariat and to the SCRS taking into account CPC confidentiality requirements. 37 67. CPCs shall submit all relevant data and administer scientific observer programs for tropical tunas in accordance with Rec. 16-14. In 2025, the SCRS shall provide advice on the improvements to observer programs including how coverage should be stratified ac ross vessels, seasons and areas to achieve maximum effectiveness. The SCRS shall consider available information to recommend, where appropriate, improvements to ICCAT standards. 68. CPCs shall endeavour to further increase observer coverage rates for longline vessels, including through trials and implementation of electronic monitoring to supplement human observers. For purse seine vessels flying their flag and targeting bigeye, yellowfin and/or skipjack in the Convention area, CPCs shall ensure 100% observer coverage of fishing effort, through the presence of an observer on board in accordance with Annex 7 or through implementation of EMS that is consistent with the requirements of Rec. 23-18. CPCs shall report the information collected by the observers or a combination of observers and EMS from the previous year in accordance with Rec. 23-18 and Rec. 16- 14 to the ICCAT Secretariat and to the SCRS, taking into account CPC confidentiality requirements. 69. In any case, the purse seine flag CPC may maintain the coverage of 20% of human observers, provided that it implements the EMS in the remaining 80% of its entire fleet, for a 100% coverage and the EMS information is audited in all its components, informing the Secretariat of the periodic audit reports carried out by whoever the CPC designates for this purpose. 70. Each year, the ICCAT Secretariat shall compile the information collected under observer and EMS programs, including on the coverage for each tropical tuna fishery, and make it available to the Commission before the annual meeting for further deliberation, taking into account CPC confidentiality requirements. 71. The IMM Working Group shall consider and provide recommendations to the Commission on the possible scope and benefits of ICCAT adopting a regional Observer Program for tropical tuna fisheries taking into account the need for harmonization and coordination of national observer programs and the possible use of electronic monitoring systems for tropical tuna fisheries. 72. On the basis of the advice from IMM Working Group, the Commission shall consider how to use existing schemes of observers, deployed onboard vessels authorized to fish for tropical tunas in ICCAT. For this purpose, the CPC whose flag or chartered vessel inv olved in already existing observers’ programs should provide details about these schemes to the Secretariat by 31 March 2025, including the copy of the agreement endorsed by the flag State and the applicable CPC of the observers. Port sampling programme 73. The port sampling programme developed by the SCRS in 2012 shall be continued for landing or transhipment ports. Data and information collected from this sampling programme shall be reported to ICCAT each year, describing, at a minimum, the following by country of landing and quarter: species composition, landings by species, length composition, and weights. Biological samples suitable for determining life history should be collected as practicable. SCRS shall report each year on the implementation of the port sampling programme broken down by CPCs. 74. In 2025, the IMM shall discuss control measures relating to: a) the use of FADs, including the feasibility, utility and effectiveness of establishing a FAD registry taking into account the existence of complete information on active vessels and their VMS operations, as well as monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) measures; b) the timely processing of data for all tropical tuna fisheries in the Convention area, including for FADs, in accordance with the tasks in Annex 8; c) the improvement of the quantity and quality of size sampling. 38 PART VI MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES/MANAGEMENT STRATEGY EVALUATION (MSE) Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) and Candidate Harvest Control Rules 75. The SCRS shall refine the MSE process in line with the roadmap adopted by the Commission. Based on input from Panel 1 on interim operational management objectives starting in 2025 in the Resolution by ICCAT on interim operational management objectives for Atlantic bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and the eastern stock of skipjack tuna (Res. 24-02), the SCRS should continue testing the candidate management procedures. In 2026 or as soon as possible thereafter, the Commission shall review the candidate management procedures, including pre -agreed management actions to be taken under vario us stock conditions. These shall take into account the differential impacts of fishing operations (e.g. purse seine, longline and baitboat) on juvenile mortality and the yield at MSY, as well as other impacts of these fisheries, including impacts on bycatch, ecosystem impacts and socio-economic impacts. PART VII FINAL PROVISIONS Availability of data to the SCRS and to national scientists 76. CPCs shall ensure that: a. Both paper and/or electronic fishing logbooks and the FAD logbooks referred to in paragraph 40, where applicable, are promptly collected and made available to national scientists; b. Their Task 1, 2 and 3 data, including catch at size, shall include active vessels, support vessel activity, FADs, observers and summary of port sampling. The information collected from the fishing or/and FAD logbooks, where applicable, is submitted every year to the ICCAT Executive Secretary, to be made available to the SCRS. 77. CPCs should encourage their national scientists to undertake collaborative work with their national industry to analyse data derived from all fisheries, including those related to FADs (e.g. logbooks, buoy data) and to present the outcomes of that analysis to the SCRS. CPCs should take steps to facilitate making the data available for such collaborative work, consistent with relevant CPC confidentiality requirements. Confidentiality 78. All data submitted in accordance with this Recommendation shall be treated in a manner consistent with Rules and procedures for the protection, access to, and dissemination of data compiled by ICCAT and solely for the purposes of this Recommendation and in accordance with the requirements and procedures developed by the Commission. Final provisions 79. Actions required from the SCRS and the ICCAT Secretariat: a) The SCRS shall explore the efficacy that full fishery closures along the lines of those proposed in PA1_505A/20196 might have to reduce the catches of tropical tunas to the agreed levels; and the potential of such scheme to reduce the catches of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tunas, in line with recommendations from the SCRS; b) The ICCAT Secretariat shall work with the SCRS in preparing an estimate of capacity in the Convention area, to include at least all the fishing units that are large -scale or operate outside the EEZ of the CPC they are registered in. All CPCs shall cooperate with this work, providing estimates of the number of fishing units fishing for tuna and tuna-like species under their flag, and the species or species groups each fishing unit targets (e.g. tropical tunas, temperate tunas, swordfish, other billfish, small tunas, sharks, etc.).

Management objectives should be established for Atlantic bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and the eastern stock of skipjack tuna consistent with the objective of the Convention of maintaining populations at or above levels that will support maximum sustainable catch (usually referred to as MSY). 2. When assessing stock status and providing management recommendations to the Commission, the SCRS shall consider the interim limit reference point (LRP) of 0.4*B MSY for Atlantic bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and the eastern stock of skipjack tuna. The SCRS will advise on final LRPs for Atlantic bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and the eastern stock of skipjack tunas. 3. The following interim operational management objectives should be considered for the purpose of developing, testing and refining candidate management procedures: a. Stock Status: Bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and the eastern stock of skipjack tuna should each have a 50% or greater probability of occurring in the green quadrant of the Kobe phase plot (no overfishing occurring and not overfished) during the XX -year projection period ( as determined by the SCRS); b. Safety: Bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and the eastern stock of skipjack tuna should each have a 15% or less probability of falling below the limit reference point at any point during the XX -year projection period; 51 c. Yield: Overall catch levels should be maximized to the extent possible with respect to each stock of bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and the eastern skipjack tuna1; d. Stability: Any change in total allowable catch (TAC) between consecutive management periods for each stock of bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and eastern skipjack tuna should be no more than a 25% increase or a 25% decrease. 4. In the development of the operating models for the multi -stock tropical tunas MSE, the Commission calls on the SCRS, consistent with paragraph 75 of Recommendation by ICCAT replacing Recommendation 22-01 on a multi-annual conservation and management programme for tropical tunas (Rec. 24-01), to evaluate the differential impacts of fishing operations (e.g., purse seine, longline, and baitboat) on the whole range of the stock, including on juvenile mortality and yield at MSY, as well as other impacts of these fisheries, including impacts on bycatch, ecosystem impacts and socio-economic impacts. 5. These interim operational management objectives will be forwarded to the SCRS for review and evaluation through the MSE process. 6. Panel 1 will provide its recommendations to confirm or amend the management objectives for Atlantic bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and the eastern stock of skipjack tuna, considering SCRS input, to the Commission for consideration as part of the selection of a management procedure at its 2026 Annual Meeting or as soon as possible thereafter. Panel 1 should consider whether the management objectives should be the same for the three stocks or if an asymmetric approach for each stock be more appropriate. 7. This Resolution will be repealed upon adoption of management procedures for Atlantic bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and the eastern stock of skipjack tuna by the Commission. 1 The SCRS shall use yields over the short (e.g., 1 -3 years), medium (e.g., 4 -10 years), and long (e.g., 11 -20 years) terms as primary performance indicators to evaluate this management objective. 52 24-04 TRO RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON A CANDIDATE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE FOR WESTERN ATLANTIC SKIPJACK TUNA (Entry into force 16 June 2025) RECALLING the intent of the Commission to adopt management procedures (MPs) tested through management strategy evaluation (MSE) for priority stocks, including western skipjack tuna, as established in the Recommendation by ICCAT on the development of harvest control rules and of management strategy evaluation (Rec. 15-07) to manage fisheries more effectively in the face of identified uncertainties; RECALLING the application of the precautionary approach in accordance with relevant international standards as established in the Resolution by ICCAT concerning the use of a precautionary approach in implementing ICCAT conservation and management measures (Res. 15-12); TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the efforts to sustainably manage the western Atlantic skipjack stock, consistent with the objectives of the Convention and the Recommendation by ICCAT on the principles of decision making for ICCAT conservation and management measures (Rec. 11-13); TAKING FURTHER INTO ACCOUNT the relatively short life cycle and highly variable population dynamic of the skipjack tuna species; NOTING the conclusions of the 2022 Stock Assessment conducted by the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS), which indicated that the western Atlantic skipjack stock is most likely located in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot, indicating that the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring; RECALLING that the preliminary performance indicators agreed to by the Commission for tropical tunas, as outlined in Recommendation by ICCAT on a Multi -annual Conservation and Management Programme for Tropical Tunas (Rec. 16-01), included four categories of management objectives, namely Status, Safety, Yield and Stability; RECALLING the conceptual management objectives agreed by ICCAT for western skipjack in Resolution by ICCAT on development of initial conceptual management objectives for western Atlantic skipjack (Res. 22-02); NOTING that the objective of the Convention is to maintain populations of tuna and tuna -like species at levels that will support maximum sustainable catch (usually referred to as Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)); CONSIDERING the work of the SCRS since 2020 to test through MSE several candidate MPs; RECALLING that the Commission requested the SCRS to continue testing various candidate MPs in 2024 and to meet with Panel 1 to review the results and support the Panel in selecting one to adopt in 2024 and for this purpose Panel 1 held three intersessional meetings in 2024, including one dedicated to the Western Skipjack MSE; RECOGNISING that after 6 years of implementation of the MP it is advisable to review; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Part I General provisions 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) whose vessels fish for western Atlantic skipjack tuna in the Convention area shall implement the following [MP]. This [MP] shall be used to calculate the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for the western Atlantic management area for 2026 and beyond. 53 Management objectives 2. The management objectives for the western Atlantic skipjack tuna stock are: a) Stock status: The stock should have a 60% or greater probability of occurring in the green quadrant of the Kobe matrix over the medium -term (4 -10 years) using a 30 -year projection period. b) Safety: There should be no greater than 10% probability of the stock falling below BLIM (0.4*BMSY) at any point during the 30-year projection period. c) Yield: Maximize overall catch levels. d) Stability: Any changes in TAC between management periods should be 25% or less. Performance indicators used to evaluate MP performance for each management objective are found in Annex 1. Part II Management procedure and exceptional circumstances 3. Consistent with the management objectives specified in paragraph 2, the [XX] management procedure has been selected. TAC setting 4. The first constant annual TAC derived from the MP shall apply in 2026, 2027, and 2028. The management cycle length shall be three years; therefore, the MP shall be applied every three years. The procedure for the establishment of the 3-year constant annual TAC is set out in Annex 2. 5. According to the timeline set out in Annex 2, the SCRS shall run the MP and advise the Commission of the resulting TAC per the process specified in Annex 2. 6. The Commission shall then adopt the TAC based on the outcome of the MP, unless the SCRS identifies exceptional circumstances that require consideration of alternative management actions to be taken by the Commission. 7. The SCRS shall assess the occurrence of exceptional circumstances annually and the Commission shall act in accordance with the exceptional circumstances protocol, developed based on scientific advice provided by the SCRS and adopted by the Commission. Part III Final provisions 8. In 2025, the SCRS shall finalize tuning of the MP to achieve the status objective specified in paragraph 2 for review and adoption by the Commission at its 2025 Annual Meeting. This measure will be revised in 2025, and the final MP specifications will become Annex 3 of this Recommendation. 9. Panel 1 shall develop an approach to maintain catches within the TAC for review and adoption by the Commission at its 2025 Annual Meeting. 10. Panel 1, with scientific guidance from the SCRS, shall develop the exceptional circumstances protocol for this MP for review and adoption by the Commission at its 2025 Annual Meeting or as soon as possible thereafter. The protocol will become Annex 4 of this Recommendation once adopted. 54 11. A review of the performance of the MP by the Commission and the SCRS shall be completed by 2031 and every 6 years thereafter. The aim of the review is to ensure the MP is performing as expected and to determine whether there are conditions that justify its continuation, or that warrant reconditioning the MSE operating models; retuning the existing MP; including new indices into a new MP; and/or considering alternate candidate management procedures or development of a new MSE framework. Based on that review and subsequent SCRS advice, the Commission shall decide on future management measures, approaches, and strategies, including, inter alia, regarding TAC levels, for western Atlantic skipjack. 12. This Recommendation repeals and replaces Resolution by ICCAT on development of initial conceptual management objectives for western Atlantic skipjack (Res. 22-02). 55 Annex 1 Table of operational management objectives and performance indicators Management objectives Corresponding performance indicators Status The stock should have a 60% or greater probability of occurring in the green quadrant of the Kobe matrix over the medium-term (4- 10 years) using a 30-year projection period.

Contracting Parties, Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities shall prohibit the use of driftnets for fisheries of large pelagics in the Mediterranean. 60 16-05 SWO RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT REPLACING THE RECOMMENDATION [13-04] AND ESTABLISHING A MULTI-ANNUAL RECOVERY PLAN FOR MEDITERRANEAN SWORDFISH (Entry into force 12 June 2017) RECOGNIZING the outcome of the stock assessment conducted by SCRS in 2016, and in particular the overfished status of the stock over the last 30 years, as well as its current overfishing; NOTING the high proportion of juveniles swordfish in the catches and its negative impact on the spawning biomass per recruit levels; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the recommendation by SCRS to substantially reduce catches, and to increase the monitoring of landings and discards; ACKNOWLEDGING the recommendation by SCRS to take into account the impact of the albacore fishery on the level of catches of juvenile swordfish; RECALLING the provisions of ICCAT Recommendation [11-13] and, for stocks overfished and subject to overfishing, the need to rebuild the stock and reduce fishing mortality; ACKNOWLEDGING the socio economic dimension of the small scale Mediterranean fisheries and the need for a gradual approach and flexibility in managing these fisheries; RECALLING the provisions of Resolution by ICCAT on Criteria for the Allocation of Fishing Possibilities [Res. 15-13] regarding the criteria for the allocation of fishing possibilities; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Part I General Provisions 1. The Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as CPCs), whose vessels have been actively fishing for swordfish ( Xyphias gladius) in the Mediterranean shall implement a 15 year Recovery plan starting in 2017 and continuing through 2031, with the goal of achieving BMSY with at least 60% probability. Part II Conservation Measures Total Allowable Catch 2. For the year 2017, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) shall be set at 10,500 t 17F 1. This shall not be prejudging of the discussions to take place in the context of the Working Group referred to under paragraph 3 of this Recommendation. 3. An ICCAT Working Group shall be established in February 2017 in order to: a) establish a fair and equitable allocation scheme of the TAC of Mediterranean swordfish. b) establish a CPC quota for 2017 without prejudice to the allocation scheme aforementioned. c) establish the mechanism to manage the TAC. 1 On the basis of the levels of captures since 2010. 61 The Working Group shall, in the context of the establishment of the allocation key, use transparent and objective criteria, including those of an environmental, social and economic nature, and notably take into consideration Resolution by ICCAT on Criteria for the allocation of fishing possibilities [Res. 15-13]. 4. Over the period 2018-2022, the TAC should be gradually reduced by 3% each year. 5. The approach specified under paragraphs 2 and 4 shall continue to apply until a mutually agreed TAC allocation is adopted through a supplementary Recommendation. Capacity limitations 6. A capacity limitation shall be applied for the duration of the Recovery plan. In 2017 CPCs shall limit the number of their fishing vessels authorised to fish for Mediterranean swordfish to the average yearly number of their vessels that fished for, retain ed on board, transhipped, transported, or landed Mediterranean swordfish over the period 2013-2016. However, CPCs may decide to use the number of their vessels that fished for, retained on board, transhipped, transported, or landed Mediterranean swordfish in 2016, if this number is inferior to the average yearly number of vessels over the period 2013-2016. This limit shall be applied by gear type for catching vessels. 7. By derogation to paragraph 6, developing CPCs may submit a list of fishing vessels less than 7m length overall, before the 15 January 2017. From 2017 onwards, these vessels will be added to the limits referred to under paragraph 6. 8. For the years 2017, 2018 and 2019, CPCs may apply a tolerance of 5% to the capacity limit referred to under paragraph 6 of this Recommendation. 9. Developing CPCs should be allowed to submit a plan of fleet development in accordance with the fishing opportunities allocated to them in ICCAT. 10. Starting in 2018, CPCs shall submit their fishing plan to ICCAT by 15 March each year. Such plan shall include detailed information regarding the quota allocated by gear type, including to sport and recreational fisheries (if applicable) and by-catches. Closed fishing season 11. Mediterranean swordfish shall not be caught (either as a targeted species or as by -catch), retained on board, transhipped or landed during either: a) the period from 1 October to 30 November and during an additional period of one month between 15 February and 31 March, b) or, alternatively, during the period from 1 January to 31 March each year. The CPCs shall communicate to the Commission, by 15 January 2017, the details of the closure periods of their choice. 12. In order to protect juvenile swordfish, a closure period shall also apply to longline vessels targeting Mediterranean albacore (Thunnus alalunga) from the 1 October to 30 November each year. 13. CPCs shall monitor the effectiveness of the closure periods referred to under paragraphs 11 and 12, and shall submit to the Commission, at the latest two months before the Annual meeting of the Commission, all relevant information on appropriate contro ls and inspections to ensure compliance with these measures. Minimum size 14. Only entire specimens of swordfish, without removal of any external part, or gilled and gutted specimens, can be retained on board, landed, transhipped and first transported after landing. 62 15. In order to protect small swordfish, CPCs shall take the necessary measures to prohibit catching, retaining on board, landing, transporting, storing, selling, displaying or offering for sale Mediterranean swordfish measuring less than 100 cm LJFL or, in a lternative, weighing less than 11,4 kg of round weight or 10,2 kg of gilled and gutted weight. 16. Prior to the 2017 Annual meeting, SCRS shall provide the Commission with the confirmed average round weight and gilled and gutted weight, corresponding to the LJFL of 100cm. 17. Incidental catch of Mediterranean swordfish below the minimum size referred to under paragraph 15 shall not be kept on board the fishing vessel, transhipped, landed, sold, displayed or offered for sale. However, the CPCs may grant tolerance to vessels which have incidentally captured small fish below the minimum size, with the condition that this incidental catch shall not exceed 5 % by weight or/and number of pieces per landing of the total swordfish catch of the said vessels Technical characteristics of the fishing gear 18. The maximum number of hooks that can be set or taken on board of vessels targeting swordfish should be fixed at 2500 hooks. A second set of rigged hooks may be allowed on board for trips longer than 2 days provided that it is duly lashed and stowed in lower decks so that it may not readily be used. 19. Hook size should never be smaller than 7 cm of height for fishing targeting swordfish. 20. The length of the pelagic longlines will be of maximum 30 NM (55 km). Sport and recreational fisheries 21. CPCs shall provide to the ICCAT Secretariat the lists of all sport and recreational vessels authorized to catch swordfish in the Mediterranean Sea, at least 15 days before the exercise of the activities. Vessels not introduced on this list shall not be aut horized to catch Mediterranean swordfish. The format for submitting such list shall be simplified and include the following information: − Name of vessel, register number − ICCAT Record Number (if any) − Previous name (if any) − Vessel's length − Name and address of owner(s) and operator(s) 22. Only 'rod and line' vessels shall be authorised for the purpose of sport and recreational fishing for Mediterranean swordfish. 23. CPCs shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the catch and retention on board, transhipment or landing of more than one Mediterranean swordfish per vessel per day for sport and recreational fisheries. 24. The marketing of Mediterranean swordfish caught in sport and recreational fishing shall be prohibited. 25. Each CPC shall take measures to record catch data including round weight and length (LJFL) of each Mediterranean swordfish caught in the context of sport and recreational fishing and transmit them to the SCRS. 26. Each CPC shall take the necessary measures to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, the release of Mediterranean swordfish caught alive in the framework of sport and recreational fishing, especially juveniles. Any Mediterranean swordfish however landed should be done so whole or gilled and gutted, and either in a designated port referred to under paragraph 31 of this recommendation, or with a tag affixed to each piece. Each tag shall have unique country specific number and be tamper proof. A summary of the implementation of the tagging programme shall be submitted to ICCAT Secretariat by the CPC. The use of such tags shall only be authorized when the accumulated catch amounts are within the quota allocated to the CPC. 63 Part III Control measures ICCAT records of vessels authorized to catch Mediterranean swordfish 27. At the latest on the 15 January each year, CPCs shall provide to the ICCAT Secretariat the list of all catching vessels authorized to fish actively for swordfish. If needed, CPCs shall be able to modify this list during the year by providing an updated list to the ICCAT Secretariat. CPCs shall provide this list according to the format set out in the Guidelines for Submitting Data and Information Required by ICCAT. 28. By 15 June 2017, CPCs shall provide to the ICCAT Secretariat the list of all catching vessels authorized to fish actively for Mediterranean albacore tuna ( Thunnus alalunga ). For the subsequent years the deadline is set at 15 March. CPCs shall provide this list according to the format set out in the Guidelines for Submitting Data and Information Required by ICCAT. 29. Procedures referred in the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels over 20 Meters in Length Overall or Greater Authorized to Operate in the Convention Area [Rec. 13-13]18F 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis. By-catch 30. CPCs may allow by -catch of Mediterranean swordfish by vessels not authorised to fish actively Mediterranean swordfish, as referred to under paragraph 27 of this recommendation, if the CPCs establish a maximum by -catch limit per vessel and per fishing oper ation and that the by -catch in question are deducted from the CPC's TAC. Each CPC shall provide, in its fishing plan referred to under paragraph 10 of this recommendation, the maximum by-catch limit it allows for its vessels. Designated ports 31. Fishing vessels shall only land Mediterranean swordfish catches, including by-catches and fish caught in the context of sport and recreational fisheries but not tagged as referred to under paragraph 26, in designated ports of CPCs. To this end, each CPC s hall designate ports in which landing Mediterranean swordfish is authorized and communicate a list of these ports to the ICCAT Secretariat by 1 March each year. For a port to be determined as designated port, the port State shall specify permitted land ing times and places. On the basis of this information the ICCAT Secretariat shall maintain a list of designated ports on the ICCAT website. 32. Prior to entry into port, the fishing vessels or their representative shall provide the relevant authorities of the port with the following: a) estimated time of arrival; b) estimate of quantity of Mediterranean swordfish retained on board; c) the information on the geographic area where the catch was taken. Port State authorities shall keep a record of all prior notices for the current year. 33. CPC shall establish the minimum length overall of the vessels concerned by paragraphs 31 and 32. Controls of landings 34. Each CPC shall take the necessary measures to control landings of Mediterranean swordfish, and notify these measures to ICCAT when submitting its fishing plan as referred to under paragraph 10 of this recommendation. 2 This measure was repealed and replaced by Recommendation 21-14. 64 Recording and Communication of catches 35. Each CPC shall ensure that during their period of authorisation, referred to under paragraph 27 of this recommendation, its catching vessels more than 15m fishing actively for Mediterranean swordfish communicate, by electronic or other means to their comp etent authorities, weekly information, including the date, time, location (latitude and longitude) and the weight and number of Mediterranean swordfish taken in the plan area. Such communication shall only be required when catches are reported over the period considered. 36. Each CPC shall take the necessary measures to ensure that all catches by vessels flying its flag are recorded and communicated without delay to the competent authority. 37. CPCs shall report quarterly the amount of Mediterranean swordfish caught by vessels flying their flag to the Secretariat within 30 days of the end of the period during which the catches were made. Transhipment 38. Transhipment operations at sea of Mediterranean swordfish shall be prohibited. Part IV ICCAT Scheme of Joint International Inspection in International Waters 39. In the framework of the Multi-annual Recovery Plan for Mediterranean swordfish, each CPC agrees, in accordance with Article IX, paragraph 3, of the ICCAT Convention, to apply the ICCAT Scheme of Joint International Inspection adopted during its Fourth Regular Meeting, held in November 1975 in Madrid, as modified in Annex 1. 40. The Scheme referred to in paragraph 39 of this Recommendation shall apply in international waters until ICCAT adopts a monitoring, control and surveillance scheme which will include an ICCAT scheme for joint international inspection, based on the results of the Integrated Monitoring Measures Working Group, established by the Resolution by ICCAT for Integrated Monitoring Measures [Res. 00-20]. 41. When at any time, more than 50 catching vessels of anyone CPC are engaged in Mediterranean swordfish directed fishing activities, the CPC shall, during that time have an inspection vessel in the Convention area, or shall cooperate with another CPC to jointly operate an inspection vessel. Part V Scientific information 42. CPCs shall ensure the maintenance or development of adequate scientific information for highly migratory pelagic species in the Mediterranean. In particular, CPCs shall take the necessary measures and actions to better estimate: − Region specific size and age at maturity; − Habitat use for comparison of the availability of swordfish to the various fisheries, including comparisons between traditional and mesopelagic longlines; − The impact of the mesopelagic longline fisheries in terms of catch composition, CPUE series, size distribution of the catches; and − Monthly estimation of spawner and recruit proportion in the catches. 43. By 31 July each year, CPCs shall communicate specific information for the fishing vessels that were authorized to carry out pelagic longline fisheries and harpoons in the Mediterranean during the preceding year: a) Specific information on the fishing vessel: − Name of the vessel (if no name, the registry number without country initials should be indicated); − Registry number; − ICCAT list number; 65 CPCs shall communicate this list electronically to the ICCAT Secretariat according to the format set out in the Guidelines for Submitting Data and Information Required by ICCAT. b) Specific information related to fishing activities, based on sampling or for the whole fleet: − Fishing period(s) and total annual number of fishing days of the vessel, by target species and area; − Geographical areas, by ICCAT statistical rectangles, for the fishing activities carried out by the vessel, by target species and area; − Type of vessel, by target species and area; − Number of hooks used by the vessel, by target species and area; − Number of longline units used by the vessel, by target species and area; − Overall length of all longline units for the vessel, by target species and area. c) Specific data on the catches, in the smallest time-area possible: − Size and, if possible, age distributions of the catches, − Catches and catch composition per vessel and, − Fishing effort (average fishing days per vessel, average number of hooks per vessel, average longline units per vessel, average overall length of longline per vessel). These data shall be provided to SCRS in the format required by ICCAT. Scientific observers 44. Each CPC shall ensure that national scientific observers are deployed on at least 5% of its pelagic longline vessels over 15 m length overall targeting Mediterranean swordfish. Each CPC shall design and implement a methodology to collect the information on the activities of the longline vessels below and up to 15 m length overall. Consistent with ICCAT Rec. [16 -14] and any amendment thereto each CPC shall report this information to SCRS. In addition to the requirement of ICCAT Rec. [16-14], scientific observers shall in particular assess and report on the level of discards of undersized swordfish. Review 45. The SCRS shall provide in 2019 an updated assessment of the state of the stock on the basis of the most recent data available. It shall assess the effectiveness of this Recovery plan and provide advice on possible amendments of the various measures. SCRS shall advice the Commission on the appropriate characteristics of the fishing gear, the closure period for the sport and recreational fishery, as well as the minimum size to be implemented for Mediterranean swordfish. 46. Based on such scientific advice, by the end of 2019 the ICCAT shall adopt changes of the management framework for swordfish, including the revision of the catch limits and alternative management scenarios, in case this is necessary to comply with the management objectives. Repeals 47. This Recommendation replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT for Management Measures for Mediterranean Swordfish in the Framework of ICCAT [Rec. 13-04]. 66 Annex 1 ICCAT Scheme of Joint International Inspection Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article IX of the Convention, the ICCAT Commission recommends the establishment of the following arrangements for international control outside the waters under national jurisdiction for the purpose of ensuring the application of the Convention and the measures in force thereunder: I. Serious violations 1. For the purposes of these procedures, a serious violation means the following violations of the provisions of the ICCAT conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission: (a) fishing without a license, permit or authorization issued by the flag CPC; (b) failure to maintain sufficient records of catch and catch -related data in accordance with the Commission’s reporting requirements or significant misreporting of such catch and/or catch - related data; (c) fishing in a closed area; (d) fishing during a closed season; (e) intentional taking or retention of species in contravention of any applicable conservation and management measure adopted by the ICCAT; (f) significant violation of catch limits or quotas in force pursuant to the ICCAT rules; (g) using prohibited fishing gear; (h) falsifying or intentionally concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel; (i) concealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to investigation of a violation; (j) multiple violations which taken together constitute a serious disregard of measures in force pursuant to the ICCAT; (k) assault, resist, intimidate, sexually harass, interfere with, or unduly obstruct or delay an authorized inspector or observer; (l) intentionally tampering with or disabling the vessel monitoring system; (m) such other violations as may be determined by the ICCAT, once these are included and circulated in a revised version of these procedures; (n) interference with the satellite monitoring system and/or operation of a vessel without a VMS system; (o) transhipment at sea 2. In the case of any boarding and inspection of a fishing vessel during which the authorized inspectors observe an activity or condition that would constitute a serious violation, as defined in paragraph 1, the authorities of the flag State of the inspection vessel shall immediately notify the flag State of the fishing vessel, directly as well as through the ICCAT Secretariat. In such situations, the inspector should, also inform any inspection ship of the flag State of the fishing vessel known to be in the vicinity. 3. ICCAT inspectors should register the inspections undertaken and the infringements detected (if any) in the fishing vessel logbook. 4. The flag State CPC shall ensure that, following the inspection referred to in paragraph 2 of this Annex, the fishing vessel concerned ceases all fishing activities. The flag State CPC shall require the fishing vessel to proceed within 72 hours to a port designated by it, where an investigation shall be initiated. 5. In the case where an inspection has detected an activity or condition that would constitute a serious violation, the vessel should be reviewed under the procedures described in the Recommendation by ICCAT Further Amending Recommendation 09 -10 Establishing a List of Vessels Presumed to Have Carried Out Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Activities in the ICCAT Convention Area [Rec. 11-18] 3, taking into account any response actions and other follow up. 3 This measure was repealed and replaced by Recommendations 18-08, 21-13 and 23-16. 67 II. Conduct of inspections 6. Inspections shall be carried out by inspectors designated by the Contracting Governments. The names of the authorized government agencies and individual inspectors designated for that purpose by their respective governments shall be notified to the ICCAT Commission; 7. Ships carrying out international boarding and inspection duties in accordance with this Annex shall fly a special flag or pennant approved by the ICCAT Commission and issued by the ICCAT Secretariat. The names of the ships so used shall be notified to the ICCAT Secretariat as soon as practical in advance of the commencement of inspection activities. The ICCAT Secretariat shall make information regarding designated inspection vessels available to all CPCs, including by posting on its password -protected website; 8. Inspectors shall carry appropriate identity documentation issued by the authorities of the flag State, which shall be in the form shown in paragraph 21 of this Annex; 9. Subject to the arrangements agreed under paragraph 16 of this Annex, a vessel flagged to a Contracting Government and fishing for tuna or tuna -like fishes in the Convention area outside waters under national jurisdiction shall stop when given the appropriate signal in the International Code of Signals by a ship flying the ICCAT pennant described in paragraph 7 and carrying an inspector unless the vessel is actually carrying out fishing operations, in which case it shall stop immediately once it has finished such operations. The master of the vessel shall permit the inspection party, as specified in paragraph 10 of this Annex, to board it and must provide a boarding ladder. The master shall enable the inspection party to make such examination of equipment, catch or gear and any relevant documents as an inspector deems necessary to verify compliance with the ICCAT Commission’s recommendations in force in relation to the flag State of the vessel being inspected. Further, an inspector may ask for any explanations that he or she deems necessary; 10. The size of the inspection party shall be determined by the commanding officer of the inspection vessel taking into account relevant circumstances. The inspection party should be as small as possible to accomplish the duties set out in this Annex safely and securely. 11. Upon boarding the vessel, inspectors shall produce the identity documentation described in paragraph 8 of this Annex. Inspectors shall observe generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to the safety of the vessel being inspected and its crew, and shall minimize interference with fishing activities or stowage of product and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board; Inspectors shall limit their enquiries t o the ascertainment of the observance of the ICCAT Commission’s recommendations in force in relation to the flag State of the vessel concerned. In making the inspection, inspectors may ask the master of the fishing vessel for any assistance he may require. Inspectors shall draw up a report of the inspection in a form approved by the ICCAT Commission. Inspectors shall sign the report in the presence of the master of the vessel who shall be entitled to add or have added to the report any observations which he or she may think suitable and must sign such observations. 12. Copies of the report shall be given to the master of the vessel and to the government of the inspection party, which shall transmit copies to the appropriate authorities of the flag State of the inspected vessel and to the ICCAT Commission. Where any i nfringement of ICCAT recommendations is discovered, the inspector should, where possible, also inform any inspection ship of the flag State of the fishing vessel known to be in the vicinity; 13. Resistance to inspectors or failure to comply with their directions shall be treated by the flag State of the inspected vessel in a manner similar to such conduct committed with respect to a national inspector; 14. Inspectors shall carry out their duties under these arrangements in accordance with the rules set out in this recommendation, but they shall remain under the operational control of their national authorities and shall be responsible to them; 68 15. Contracting Governments shall consider and act on inspection reports, sighting information sheets as per Recommendation [94 -0920 4] and statements resulting from documentary inspections of foreign inspectors under these arrangements on a similar basis in accordance with their national legislation to the reports of national inspectors. The provisions of this paragraph shall not impose any obligation on a Contracting Government to give the report of a foreign inspector a higher evidential value than it would possess in the inspector’s own country. Contracting Governments shall collaborate in order to facilitate judicial or other proceedings arising from a report of an inspector under these arrangements; 16. a) Contracting Governments shall inform the ICCAT Commission by 1 January each year of their provisional plans for conducting inspection activities under this recommendation in that calendar year and the Commission may make suggestions to Contracting Governments for the coordination of national operations in this field including the number of inspectors and ships carrying inspectors; b) the arrangements set out in this recommendation and the plans for participation shall apply between Contracting Governments unless otherwise agreed between them, and such agreement shall be notified to the ICCAT Commission. Provided, however, that imp lementation of the scheme shall be suspended between any two Contracting Governments if either of them has notified the ICCAT Commission to that effect, pending completion of such an agreement; 17. a) the fishing gear shall be inspected in accordance with the regulations in force for the subarea for which the inspection takes place. Inspectors will state the subarea for which the inspection took place, and a description of any violations found, in the inspection report; b) inspectors shall have the authority to inspect all fishing gear in use or on board; 18. Inspectors shall affix an identification mark approved by the ICCAT Commission to any fishing gear inspected which appears to be in contravention of the ICCAT Commission’s recommendations in force in relation to the flag State of the vessel concerned and shall record this fact in his/her report; 19. The inspector may photograph the gears, equipment, documentation and any other element he/she considers necessary in such a way as to reveal those features which in their opinion are not in conformity with the regulation in force, in which case the subjects photographed should be listed in the report and copies of the photographs should be attached to the copy of the report to the flag State; 20. Inspectors shall, as necessary, inspect all catch on board to determine compliance with ICCAT recommendations. 21. The model Identity Card for inspectors is as follows: Dimensions: Width 10.4cm, Height 7cm 4 This measure was repealed and replaced by Recommendation 19-09. INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNA ICCAT ICCAT INSPECTOR IDENTITY CARD The holder of this document is an ICCAT inspector duly appointed under the terms of the ICCAT Scheme of Joint International Inspection and has the authority to act under the provision of the ICCAT Control and Enforcement measures Contracting Party: Inspector Name: Card No.: Issue Date: Validity five years CPC Authority Inspector 69 17-03 SWO RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT AMENDING THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SOUTH ATLANTIC SWORDFISH, REC. 16-04 (Entry into force 11 June 2018) CONSIDERING that the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) indicates that substantial unquantified uncertainties affect this stock, in particular due to lack or inconsistencies of available data; CONSCIOUS that the SCRS underlined that due to the existing uncertainties there is no room to increase the existing TAC; RECOGNIZING that this multi -annual approach for the management of South Atlantic swordfish reflects the thrust of the Resolution by ICCAT on Criteria for the Allocation of Fishing Possibilities [Res. 15- 13], adopted by the Commission in 2015, for the period concerned; RECOGNISING that it would be appropriate, as already applicable to other stocks under the purview of ICCAT, to establish an ICCAT register of vessels authorized to fish South Atlantic swordfish; ACKNOWLEDGING that based on the 2017 stock assessment, the SCRS advised that the current TAC of 15,000 t has only a 26% probability of rebuilding the South Atlantic swordfish stock to within MSY reference levels by 2028, whereas a TAC of 14,000 t would have a 50% probability of rebuilding the stock; ACKNOWLEDGING that following the 2017 stock assessment the SCRS confirmed that the stock of South Atlantic swordfish is overfished; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the concerns expressed by the Panel of the second ICCAT performance review regarding the possibility to transfer high underage from year to year and that this practice is inconsistent with sound management of the stocks; SEEKING to ensure that the total catch does not exceed the annual Total Allowable Catch; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 70 TAC and catch limits 1. For 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and the catch limits shall be as follows: (1) The total catch for the four-year management period of 2018 -2021 shall not exceed 56,000 t (14,000 t x 4). If the yearly total catch of any of the four years exceeds 14,000 t; the TAC(s) for the following year(s) shall be adjusted to ensure that the four -year total will not exceed 56,000 t. In general, these adjustments shall be carried out through prorate reduction of the quota for each Contracting Party and Cooperating non-Contracting Party, Entity and Fishing Entity (CPC). (2) Brazil may harvest up to 200 t of its annual catch limit within the area between 5 degrees North latitude and 15 degrees North latitude. (3) Japan’s, U.S.A’s and Chinese Taipei’s underage in 2016 may be carried over to 2018 up to 600 t, 100 t and 300 t, respectively, in addition to their quotas specified in this table. Those CPCs may also carry over unused portions during 2017-2021 but such carried over amounts each year shall not exceed the amounts specified here. Transfers shall be authorized in accordance with paragraph 5. Underage or overage of catch 2. Any unused portion or excess of the annual quota/catch limit may be added to/shall be deducted from, according to the case, the respective quota/catch limit during or before the adjustment year, in the following way for South Atlantic swordfish: However, the maximum underage that a party may carryover in any given year shall not exceed 20% of the quota of the previous year. Transfers 3. Japan shall be allowed to count up to 400 t of its swordfish catch taken from the part of the North Atlantic management area that is east of 35 degrees W and south of 15 degrees N, against its uncaught South Atlantic swordfish quota. Catch Limit (Unit: t) TAC (1) 14,000 Brazil (2) 3,940 European Union 4,824 South Africa 1,001 Namibia 1,168 Uruguay 1,252 United States(3) 100 Cote d’Ivoire 125 China 313 Chinese Taipei(3) 459 United Kingdom 25 Japan(3) 901 Angola 100 Ghana 100 St. Tomé & Principe 100 Senegal 417 Korea 50 Belize 125 Catch Year Adjustment Year 2017 2019 2018 2020 2019 2021 2020 2022 2021 2023 71 4. The European Union shall be allowed to count up to 200 t of its swordfish catch taken from the North Atlantic management area against its uncaught South Atlantic swordfish quota. 5. The 50 t quota transfers from South Africa, Japan and United States to Namibia (total: 150 t), the 25 t quota transfers from United States to Côte d’Ivoire, the 25 t quota transfer from United States and the 50 t quota transfers from Brazil and Uruguay to Belize (total: 125 t), and the 50 t quota transfer from Brazil to Equatorial Guinea shall be authorized. The quota transfers shall be reviewed annually in response to a request from an involved CPC. Minimum size 6. In order to protect small swordfish, CPCs shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the taking of and landing of swordfish in the entire Atlantic Ocean weighing less than 25 kg live weight, or in the alternative, 125 cm lower jaw fork length (LJFL); ho wever, the CPCs may grant tolerances to boats which have incidentally captured small fish, with the condition that this incidental catch shall not exceed 15 percent of the number of swordfish per landing of the total swordfish catch of said boats. 7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, any CPC may choose, as an alternative to the minimum size of 25 kg/125 cm LJFL, to take the necessary measures to prohibit the taking by its vessels in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the landing and sale in it s jurisdiction, of swordfish (and swordfish parts), less than 119 cm LJFL, or in the alternative 15 kg, provided that, if this alternative is chosen, no tolerance of swordfish smaller than 119 LJFL, or in the alternative 15 kg, shall be allowed. For swordfish that have been dressed, a cleithrum to keel (CK) measurement of 63 cm can also be applied. A Party that chooses this alternative minimum size shall require appropriate record keeping of discards. The SCRS should continue to monitor and analyze the effects of this measure on the mortality of immature swordfish. ICCAT Record of vessels authorized to fish South Atlantic swordfish 8. CPCs shall issue specific authorizations to vessels 20 meters LOA or greater flying their flag that are authorized to fish for South Atlantic swordfish in the Convention area. Each CPC shall indicate which of such vessels it has so authorized on its vessel list submitted pursuant to the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels 20 meters in Length Overall or Greater Authorized to Operate in the Convention Area [Rec. 13-131]. Such vessels not entered into this record or entered without the required indication that fishing for South Atlantic swordfish is authorized are deemed not to be authorized to fish for, retain on board, transship, transport, transfer, process or land South Atlantic swordfish. 9. CPCs may allow bycatch of South Atlantic swordfish by vessels not authorized to fish for South Atlantic swordfish pursuant to paragraph 8, if the CPC establishes a maximum on board bycatch limit for such vessels and that the bycatch in question is account ed for within the CPC’s quota or catch limit. Each CPC shall provide in its Annual Report the maximum bycatch limit it allows for such vessels. That information shall be compiled by the ICCAT Secretariat and made available to CPCs. Availability of data to SCRS 10. CPCs shall endeavor to recover any missing catch data for years up to 2015, including reliable Task 1 and Task 2 data. CPCs will make available the above data to the SCRS as soon as possible. From 2017 onwards, CPCs shall ensure accurate and timely data submission to the SCRS. 11. All CPCs catching swordfish in the South Atlantic shall endeavor to provide annually the best available data to the SCRS, including catch, catch at size, location and month of capture on the smallest scale possible, as determined by the SCRS. The data sub mitted shall be for broadest range of age classes possible, consistent with minimum size restrictions, and by sex when possible. The data shall also include discards (both dead and alive) and effort statistics, even when no analytical stock assessment is scheduled. The SCRS shall review these data annually. 1 This measure was repealed and replaced by Recommendation 21-14. 72 12. When assessing stock status and providing management recommendations to the Commission in 2021, the SCRS shall consider the interim limit reference (LRP) of 0.4*B MSY or any more robust LRP established through further analysis. Final provisions 13. None of the arrangements in this Recommendation shall be deemed to prejudice a future arrangement relating to South Atlantic swordfish. 14. The Recommendation by ICCAT for the Conservation of South Atlantic Swordfish [Rec. 16-04] is repealed and replaced by this Recommendation. 73 22-04 SWO RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT REPLACING SUPPLEMENTAL RECOMMENDATION 21-03 EXTENDING AND AMENDING RECOMMENDATION 17-03 FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SOUTH ATLANTIC SWORDFISH (Entry into force 23 June 2023) NOTING the need to continue with sound management for the sustainable exploitation of the South Atlantic swordfish stock; CONSIDERING that in 2022 the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) provided an assessment of the status whereby it noted that the stock status is overfished and subject to overfishing and reported that the current Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of 14,000 t is unlikely (3% probability) to achieve the objective of bringing the stock to a green quadrant of a Kobe plot by 2033 and that catches at levels below 10,000 t would accelerate rebuilding of the stock; RECOGNISING that the SCRS recommended that the current levels of exploitation not be exceeded under the current exploitation patterns; CONFIRMING the commitment of CPCs to not increase their fishing efforts so as to ensure that catches will not exceed 10,000 t while acknowledging that the extension of current measures in no way prejudices any future measures or discussions, including the existing allocation; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: TAC and catch limits 1. The terms of the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation for the conservation of South Atlantic swordfish, Rec. 16-04 (Rec. 17-03) shall be extended through 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 with the following amendments: A. Paragraph 1 shall be replaced with: “1. TAC and catch limits a) The total allowable catch (TAC) shall be 10,000 t for South Atlantic swordfish for the years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026. b) The annual catch limits as shown in the table below shall be applied for the years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026: 74 (1) Brazil may harvest up to 200 t of its annual catch limit within the area between 5 degrees North latitude and 15 degrees North latitude. (2) Japan, United States, and Chinese Taipei may carryover unused portions of their respective catch limits specified in this table during 2023-2026, but such carried over amounts each year shall not exceed 600 t, 100 t and 300 t, respectively. Transfers shall be authorized in accordance with paragraph 5. c) If the annual catch exceeds the TAC of 10,000 t, CPCs that have exceeded their individual catch limits shall pay back their overharvest in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Recommendation. Any amount of the overharvest remaining after such adjustment sha ll be deducted from the annual catch limit of each CPC in the year following the excess, on a prorata basis of the catch limits in Table 1 b) above.” Paragraph 2 shall be replaced with: “2. Any unused portion or excess of the annual quota/catch limit may be added to/shall be deducted from, according to the case, the respective quota/catch limit during or before the adjustment year, in the following way for South Atlantic swordfish: TAC: 10,000 t CPC Catch Limit (Unit: t) Brazil1 3,940 European Union 4,824 South Africa 1,001 Namibia 1,168 Uruguay 1,252 United States2 100 Côte d’Ivoire 125 China 313 Chinese Taipei2 459 United Kingdom 25 Japan2 901 Angola 100 Ghana 100 St. Tomé & Principe 100 Senegal 417 Korea 50 Belize 125 Catch Year Adjustment Year 2021 2023 2022 2024 2023 2025 2024 2026 2025 2027 2026 2028 75 However, the maximum underage that a party may carryover in any given year shall not exceed 10% of the quota of the previous year.” 2. The SCRS will monitor the catch levels in 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 and report to the Commission annually. 3. This Recommendation repeals and replaces the Supplemental Recommendation by ICCAT on Recommendation 17 -03 amending the Recommendation 16 -04 for the conservation of South Atlantic Swordfish (Rec. 21-03). 76 22-20 SWO SUPPLEMENTARY RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT MODIFYING ANNEX 1 OF THE RECOMMENDATION 16-05 REPLACING THE RECOMMENDATION 13-04 AND ESTABLISHING A MULTI-ANNUAL RECOVERY PLAN FOR MEDITERRANEAN SWORDFISH (Entry into force 17 October 2023) NOTING that during the meeting of the ICCAT Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures (IMM) in June 2022, it was proposed to include specific boarding ladder provisions in the E -BFT and SWO Joint Inspection Schemes (JIS) to bring the JIS into line with the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO), North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) and General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM). FURTHER NOTING that under the E-BFT JIS, some fishing vessels were not able to consistently provide ladders to allow ICCAT inspectors to board safely. The INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Annex 1 of the Recommendation 16-05 (Mediterranean swordfish ICCAT Scheme of Joint International Inspection) be modified as follows: - A new subparagraph shall be added at the end of Section 1, paragraph 1 (Serious Violations). - Section II, paragraph 9 (Conduct of inspections) shall be amended as below. I. Serious violations 1. For the purposes of these procedures, a serious violation means the following violations of the provisions of the ICCAT conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission: p) Not providing to ICCAT inspectors a boarding ladder meeting the requirements of IMO Resolution A.889(21) to facilitate safe access to any fishing vessel which requires a climb of 1.5 metres or more. II. Conduct of inspections 9. Subject to the arrangements agreed under paragraph 16 of this Annex, a vessel flagged to a Contracting Government and fishing for tuna or tuna -like fishes in the Convention area outside waters under national jurisdiction shall stop when given the appropriate signal in the International Code of Signals by a ship flying the ICCAT pennant described in paragraph 7 of this Annex and carrying an inspector unless the vessel is actually carrying out fishing operations, in which case it shall stop immediately once it has finished such operations. The master * of the vessel shall permit the inspection party, as specified in paragraph 10 of this Annex, to board it and must provide a boarding ladder meeting the requirements of IMO Resolution A.889(21), to facilitate safe and convenient access to any vessel which requires a climb of 1.5 metres or more. The master shall enable the inspection party to make such examination of equipment, catch or gear and any relevant documents as an inspector deems necessary to verify compliance with the ICCAT Commission’s recommend ations in force in relation to the flag State of the vessel being inspected. Further, an inspector may ask for any explanations that he or she deems necessary. * Master refers to the individual in charge of the vessel. 77 24-10 SWO RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES, INCLUDING A MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE, FOR NORTH ATLANTIC SWORDFISH (Entry into force 16 June 2025) RECALLING the Supplemental Recommendation by ICCAT to amend the Rebuilding Program for North Atlantic Swordfish (Rec. 06 -02), the Recommendation by ICCAT for the conservation of North Atlantic swordfish (Rec. 10 -02, Rec. 11 -02, Rec. 16 -03), and the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation for the conservation of North Atlantic swordfish, Rec. 16-03 (Rec. 17-02) as amended by the Recommendation by ICCAT replacing Recommendation 22 -03 extending and amending Recommendation 17-02 for the conservation of North Atlantic swordfish (Rec. 23-04); FURTHER RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT on the principles of decision making for ICCAT conservation and management measures (Rec. 11-13) and the Recommendation by ICCAT on the development of Harvest Control Rules and of Management Strategy Evaluation (Rec. 15-07); NOTING that the objective of the Convention is to maintain populations of tuna and tuna -like species at levels that will support maximum sustainable catch (usually referred to as Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)); RECALLING the Commission’s work toward the development of management strategy evaluation (MSE) for North Atlantic swordfish to manage fisheries more effectively in the face of identified uncertainties, including efforts to develop operational management objectives, in particular, Resolution by ICCAT on development of initial management objectives for North Atlantic swordfish (Res. 19-14); FURTHER RECALLING that paragraph 1e) of Rec. 23 -04 called for the Commission to adopt a management procedure (MP) for North Atlantic swordfish in 2024 and apply the MP to establish the total allowable catch (TAC) for 2025-2027 and future years; ALSO RECALLING the results of the 2022 North Atlantic Swordfish Stock Assessment, which showed the stock being in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot (not overfished and no overfishing was occurring) in 2020; RECOGNIZING the total allocation of fishing opportunities for North Atlantic swordfish is superior to recent annual TAC levels and that catches have been well below these levels for many years; TAKING NOTE of the Resolution by ICCAT on criteria for the allocation of fishing possibilities (Res. 15-13); RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT regarding compliance in the bluefin tuna and North Atlantic swordfish fisheries (Rec. 96-14); SEEKING to ensure that the total catch does not exceed the annual TAC; RECOGNIZING that the North Atlantic swordfish MSE incorporates a wide range of uncertainties to ensure the selected MP that has been tested through MSE meets identified management objectives concerning status, safety, stability and yield, and supports the overall objective of the Convention; FURTHER RECOGNIZING the importance of reconciling the sum of catch limits with the TAC through any increases derived from the application of the MP for the 2028-2030 management cycle; NOTING the importance of identifying exceptional circumstances (ECs) that would result in suspending or modifying the application of the MP to remain aligned with the Recommendation by ICCAT on the principles of decision making for conservation and management measures (Rec. 11-13); 78 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: PART I GENERAL PROVISIONS 1. The Contracting Parties, and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) whose vessels catch North Atlantic swordfish in the Convention area shall implement the following conservation and management measures including the MP set out in Annex 1 for establishing annual TACs. Management objectives 2. The management objectives for the North Atlantic swordfish stock are: a) Stock Status: − The stock shall have a 60% or greater probability of occurring in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot (no overfishing occurring and not overfished); b) Safety: − There shall be a 15% or less probability of the stock falling below B LIM1 at any point during the 30-year evaluation period; c) Yield: − Overall catch levels shall be maximized; and d) Stability: − Changes in TAC shall be minimized, consistent with the specifications of the MP as described in Annex 1. Performance measures (indicators) used to evaluate the performance of MPs for each management objective are found in Annex 2. PART II MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE AND TOTAL ALLOWABLE CATCH 3. Consistent with the management objectives specified in paragraph 2, the MCC11 MP is adopted. The MP is fully described in Annex 1. 4. The TAC derived from the first application of the MP is 14,769 t and shall apply in 2025, 2026, and 2027. The management cycle length shall be three years; therefore, the MP shall be applied every three years. 5. The SCRS shall apply the MP specified in Annex 1 in accordance with the timeline set out in Annex 3 and advise the Commission of the resulting TAC for North Atlantic swordfish for the next three-year management cycle. The SCRS shall assess the occurrence of ECs annually, and the Commission shall act in accordance with the EC Protocol once adopted pursuant to paragraph 20. 6. The Commission shall adopt the TAC based on the outcome of the MP unless the SCRS identifies exceptional circumstances that require the Commission to take alternative management actions to remain aligned with the principles of Recommendation 11-13. 1 Interim limit reference point (LRP) used in the MSE was BLIM = 0.4*BMSY. 79 PART III CATCH LIMITS AND RELATED PROVISIONS Catch limits 7. The annual TAC of 14,769 t for North Atlantic swordfish resulting from the application of the MP described in Annex 1 shall be allocated as follows for the 2025-2027 management period: CPCs Catch limit* 14,769 (t) European Union1 7,408.33 United States2 3,907 Canada 1,880 Japan3 842 Morocco 1,186 Mexico 200 Brazil 50 Barbados 45 Venezuela 85 Trinidad & Tobago 125 United Kingdom 35.67 France (SPM) 40 China 111 Senegal 250 Korea4 50 Belize5 130 Côte d'Ivoire 50 St Vincent & the Grenadines 75 Costa Rica 75 Chinese Taipei 270 If Liberia submits a fishing plan clearly describing their North Atlantic swordfish fishery for Panel 4 to review at the 2025 annual meeting, Liberia's catch limit needs shall then be assessed for inclusion in the allocation table in paragraph 7 for 2026 and 2027. * The following transfers of annual catch limits shall be authorized: From Japan to Morocco: 150 t From EU to France (St Pierre et Miquelon): 40 t From Trinidad & Tobago to Belize: 75 t From Japan, and Senegal, to Mauritania: 25 t each for a total of 50 t, on the condition that Mauritania submit its development plan per paragraph 10 of this Recommendation. If a development plan is not submitted, these transfers are considered null. Future decisions regarding access to the North Atlantic swordfish fishery by Mauritania shall be contingent upon submission of its development plan From Trinidad and Tobago to Morocco: 25 t From the United States to Costa Rica: 300 t in 2025 80 These transfers do not change the relative shares of CPCs as reflected in the above catch limits. 1 The European Union shall be allowed to count up to 200 t of its swordfish catch taken from the South Atlantic management area against its uncaught North Atlantic swordfish catch limits. 2 The United States shall be allowed to count up to 200 t of its swordfish catch taken from the area between 5°N and 5°S, against its uncaught North Atlantic swordfish catch limit. 3 Japan shall be allowed to count up to 400 t of its swordfish catch taken from the South Atlantic management area against its uncaught North Atlantic swordfish catch limits. 4 Korea shall be allowed to count up to 25 t of swordfish catch taken from the South Atlantic management area against its uncaught North Atlantic catch limit. 5 Belize shall be allowed to count up to 75 t of its swordfish catch taken from the area between 5°N and 5°S, against its uncaught North Atlantic swordfish catch limit. 8. Notwithstanding the Recommendation by ICCAT regarding the temporary adjustment of quotas (Rec. 01-12), in between meetings of the Commission, a CPC with a TAC allocation of North Atlantic swordfish, as per paragraph 7, may make a one-time transfer within a fishing year of up to 15% of its TAC allocation to other CPCs with TAC allocations, cons istent with domestic obligations and conservation considerations. Any such transfer may not be used to cover overharvests. A CPC that receives a one-time catch limit transfer may not retransfer that catch limit. 9. When setting catch limits under the TAC described in paragraph 8, the Commission shall take into account the Resolution by ICCAT on criteria for the allocation of fishing possibilities (Res. 15-13). In support of this effort, the Commission shall consider development/management plans of coastal developing CPCs and fishing/management plans of other CPCs so that adjustments can be made to the existing catch limits and other conservation measures, as appropriate. In the event of the modification of its fishing/management plan, each CPC shall submit the updated version of its fishing/management plan to the Commission by 15 September. Underage or overage of catch 10. If the annual catch in any year exceeds the TAC specified in paragraph 4, CPCs that have exceeded their individual catch limits shall pay back their overharvest in accordance with paragraph 11. Any amount of the overharvest remaining after such adjustment shall be deducted from the annual catch limits of all CPCs, two years following the year in which the excess occurred, on a pro rata basis of the catch limits in paragraph 7. The Commission may also consider the need for further measures, including taking into account any advice of the SCRS pursuant to its evaluation of the existence of ECs. 11. Any unused portion or excess of the annual adjusted quota may be added to/shall be deducted from, according to the case, the respective quota/catch limit during or before the adjustment year, as follows: Catch year Adjustment year 2023 2025 2024 2026 2025 2027 2026 2028 2027 2029 However, the maximum underage that a CPC may carryover in any given year shall not exceed 15% of its initial catch limit (as specified in paragraph 7 and excluding quota transfers) for those CPCs holding catch limits more than 500 t, and 40% for other CPCs. 12. If Japan’s landings exceed its catch limits in any year, the overage shall be deducted in subsequent years so that total landings for Japan shall not exceed its total catch limits for the three -year period commencing in 2025. When annual landings by Japan are less than its catch limits during this period, the underage may be added to the subsequent years’ catch limits, so that total landings by Japan do not exceed its total for the same three -year period. Any overages from a three -year management period, including for 2025 -2027, shall be applied to the subsequent three -year management period. Any underages from a three -year management period, including for 2025 -2027, may be applied to the subsequent three-year management period if so decided by the Commission. 81 PART IV CONTROL MEASURES Specific authorization to fish for North Atlantic swordfish and ICCAT record of vessels 13. CPCs shall issue specific authorizations to vessels 20 meters LOA or greater flying their flag that are authorized to fish for North Atlantic swordfish in the Convention area. Each CPC shall indicate which of such vessels it has so authorized on its vessel list submitted pursuant to the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 13 -13 concerning the establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels 20 meters in Length Overall or greater authorized to operate in the Convention area (Rec. 21-14). Such vessels not entered into this record or entered without the required indication that fishing for North Atlantic swordfish is authorized are deemed not to be authorized to fish for, retain on board, transship, transport, transfer, process or land North Atlantic swordfish. 14. CPCs may allow bycatch of North Atlantic swordfish by vessels not authorized to fish for North Atlantic swordfish pursuant to paragraph 13, if the CPC establishes a maximum per trip onboard bycatch limit for such vessels and the bycatch in question is accounted for within the CPC's quota or catch limit. Each CPC shall provide in its Annual Report the maximum per trip bycatch limit it allows for such vessels and the total amount of North Atlantic swordfish harvested as bycatch. That information shall be compiled by the ICCAT Secretariat and made available to CPCs. Minimum sizes 15. In order to protect small swordfish, CPCs shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the taking of and landing of swordfish weighing less than 25 kg live weight, or in the alternative, 125 cm or less lower jaw fork length (LJFL); however, the CPCs may grant tolerances to boats which have incidentally captured small fish, with the condition that this incidental catch shall not exceed 15 percent of the number of swordfish per landing of the total swordfish catch of said boats. 16. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 15, any CPC may choose, as an alternative to the minimum size of 25 kg/125 cm LJFL, to take the necessary measures to prohibit the taking by its vessels in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the landing and sale in i ts jurisdiction, of swordfish (and swordfish parts), less than 15 kg/119 cm LJFL, provided that, if this alternative is chosen, no tolerance of swordfish smaller than 119 cm LJFL, or in the alternative 15 kg, shall be allowed. For swordfish that have been dressed, a cleithrum to keel (CK) measurement of 63 cm can also be applied. A CPC that chooses this alternative minimum size shall require appropriate record keeping of discards. The SCRS should continue to monitor and analyze the effects of this measure o n the mortality of immature swordfish. PART V SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 17. All CPCs catching swordfish in the North Atlantic shall provide annually the best available data to the SCRS, including catch, catch at size, location and month of capture on the smallest scale possible, as determined by the SCRS. The data submitted shall be for the broadest range of age classes possible, consistent with minimum size restrictions, and by sex when possible. The data shall also include discards (both dead and alive) and effort statistics, even when no analytical stock assessment is scheduled. The SCRS shall review these data annually. 18. The SCRS shall continue work on robustness tests, focusing particularly on the Climate Change scenarios and minimum size limits. The results shall be presented at the Commission no later than 2027 and, if needed, considered for future revisions of the pres ent conservation and management measures for North Atlantic swordfish. 19. No later than July 15, 2025, CPCs shall present to the SCRS the statistical methodology used to estimate dead discards and live releases. CPCs with artisanal and small -scale fisheries shall also provide information about their data collection programs. The SCRS shall review these methodologies and, if it determines that a methodology is not scientifically sound, the SCRS shall provide relevant feedback to the CPCs in question to improve the methodologies. Once these methods are approved CPCs should update their catch reporting to incorporate these estimated dead and live discards. 82 PART VI FINAL PROVISIONS 20. A review of the performance of the MP by the Commission and the SCRS shall be completed by 2030 as set out in Annex 3 and every 6 years thereafter. The scope of the review should be to ensure the MP is performing in line with objectives and may include: updating the operating model (OM) reference grid; reconditioning the MSE OMs; retuning the existing MP; and considering the performance of alternative candidate management procedures (CMPs) within an updated MSE framework. Based on that review and subsequent SCRS advice, the Commission shall decide on future management measures, approaches, and strategies, including, inter alia, regarding TAC levels, for North Atlantic swordfish. 21. Panel 4, with scientific guidance from the SCRS, shall develop the EC protocol for this MP during one or more intersessional meetings, as needed, for review and adoption by the Commission at its 2025 annual meeting. The protocol shall become Annex 4 of this Recommendation once adopted. 22. This Recommendation repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation for the conservation of North Atlantic swordfish, Rec. 16 -03 (Rec. 17 -02), the Resolution by ICCAT on development of initial management objectives for North Atlantic swordfish (Res. 19-14), and the Recommendation by ICCAT replacing Recommendation 22 -03 extending and amending Recommendation 17-02 for the conservation of North Atlantic swordfish (Rec. 23-04). 83 Annex 1 Description and formulae for calculating Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for North Atlantic swordfish using the MCC11 Management Procedure (MP) Specifications MCC11 The MCC11 (Mostly Constant Catch with 11 levels) management procedure is empirical and uses a single input: the North Atlantic swordfish combined index of abundance (“the Combined Index”). The goal of the MCC11 MP is to have the catch remain as constant as possible and only increase the TAC if the Combined Index increased substantially and only decrease the TAC if the Combined Index declined substantially. This MP is tuned to achieve a 60% probability of being in the Kobe green quadrant (i.e. SB≥SB MSY and F≤FMSY) in each of the three 10 -year projection time periods (short = years 1 -10; medium = years 11 -20; long = years 21-30). Abundance index The Combined Index uses catch and effort data from 7 ICCAT CPCs and draws from both Task 2 catch and effort data and detailed catch and effort records obtained directly from some CPCs, totaling over 95% of the annual catch in the North Atlantic. The initial year of the index is 1963. The index values are in kilograms of swordfish catch per 1000 hooks. This model-based index uses a Tweedie error distribution and categorical explanatory variables: year, quarter, spatial zone, a targeting variable, and a size class variable. The predicted year values are then standardized to a mean of 1 over the whole time series. These values are defined as I. MP specifications This MP uses a 3 -year management cycle length. The base TAC (constant catch) is 12,600 t; this is an approximation of the constant catch that would result in at least 60% PGK. A base TAC (TACbase) is calculated as: TACbase=𝜃12,600 where 𝜃 is the tuning parameter that results in achieving a 60% PGK in the short -term. The tuning parameter for MCC11 is 0.7562. TACbase is modified by comparing the ratio of the current 3 -year average of the Combined Index ( Icurr) to a historical 3-year average of the Combined Index (Ibase): 𝐼rat=𝐼curr 𝐼base Ibase is calculated as the average of the Combined Index from 2017 -2019. The value of 𝐼rat is used to determine how much the TACbase should be increased or decreased if at all. The TAC for the following management cycle is calculated as: 𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑦+1= TACbase∆TAC where ∆TAC is calculated as: 84 ∆TAC= { 1.85 if 𝐼rat≥1.85 1.75 if 1.75≤𝐼rat<1.85 1.65 if 1.65≤𝐼rat<1.75 1.55 if 1.55≤𝐼rat<1.65 1.45 if 1.45≤𝐼rat<1.55 1.35 if 1.35≤𝐼rat<1.45 1.25 if 1.25≤𝐼rat<1.35 1.15 if 1.15≤𝐼rat<1.25 1.00 if 0.75≤𝐼rat<1.15 0.75 if 0.5≤𝐼rat<0.75 0.5 if 𝐼rat<0.5 85 Annex 2 Performance indicators (PIs) for management objectives Performance indicators (PIs) are calculated based on 80 simulations for each of the 9 operating models (OMs) for a 30-year projection under a Candidate Management Procedure (CMP).

The SCRS should assess the impact of the reductions made on the recovery of the stock, as early as possible. 88 21-04 ALB RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES, INCLUDING A MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE AND EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES PROTOCOL, FOR NORTH ATLANTIC ALBACORE (Entry into force 17 June 2022) NOTING that the objective of the Convention is to maintain populations of tuna and tuna -like species at levels that will support maximum sustainable catch (usually referred to as Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)); RECOGNIZING the intent of the Commission to adopt Harvest Control Rules (HCRs) and Management Procedures (MPs) developed using Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), as established in Recommendation by ICCAT on the development of harvest control rules and of management strategy evaluation (Rec. 15-07); RECALLING that paragraph 18 of the Recommendation by ICCAT on a Harvest Control Rule for North Atlantic Albacore supplementing the multiannual conservation and management programme, Rec. 16 -06 (Rec. 17-04) called for the consolidation of its relevant provisions with those of the Recommendation by ICCAT on a Multi -annual Conservation and Management Program for North Atlantic Albacore (Rec. 16 -06) into a single Recommendation; FURTHER RECALLING that, in 2020, the Commission adopted the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 16-06 establishing a Multi-annual Conservation and Management Programme for North Atlantic Albacore (Rec. 20-03), and the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 17-04 on a Harvest Control Rule for North Atlantic Albacore Supplementing the Multi -annual Conservation and Management Programme in Rec. 16-06 (Rec. 20-04); NOTING that paragraph 17 of Rec. 16 -06 was amended by paragraph 4 of Rec. 20 -03 and established an obligation for the Commission to review the Rec. 16 -06, including consolidation of relevant provisions into a single recommendation in 2021; NOTING that paragraph 17 of Rec. 17 -04 was amended by paragraph 3 of Rec. 20 -04 and established an obligation for the Commission to review the interim Harvest Control Rules in 2021 with a view to adopting a long-term management procedure; RECALLING the importance that all fleets participating in the northern albacore fishery submit the required data (catch, effort and catch-at-size) on their fisheries for transmission to the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS); RECOGNISING that it is appropriate, as already applicable to other stocks under the purview of ICCAT, to maintain the ICCAT register of vessels authorized to fish North Atlantic albacore; CONSIDERING that the 2020 SCRS stock assessment concluded that the relative abundance of North Atlantic albacore has continued to increase over the last years and that the probability of the stock being in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot (not overfished and not un dergoing overfishing, F<F MSY and B>BMSY) is 98.4%; RECOGNIZING the positive external review of the MSE and that simulations conducted in 2017 and subsequent years allow the SCRS to provide robust advice for a wide range of uncertainties and meet the objectives for the North Atlantic albacore stock to be in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot with a probability higher than 60%; NOTING that the Harvest Control Rule with the highest target fishing mortalities ( FTAR=FMSY) was associated with lower probabilities, although higher than 60%, of being in the Kobe green quadrant and higher probabilities of the stock being between BLIM and BTHRESH with only slightly higher long-term yields; FURTHER NOTING the desire for stability in the fishery; 89 CONSIDERING that the SCRS tested a minimum fishing mortality (F MIN) should the stock status fall below safe biological limits; FURTHER CONSIDERING the work of the SCRS in 2018 and 2019 to test through MSE several HCR variants and the SCRS advice in 2019 that the Commission could adopt alternative harvest control rules to provide additional stability to the fisheries while meeting management objective s. These alternatives include, inter alia, applying the restriction of 20% maximum reduction in Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and 25% maximum TAC increase when B is estimated to be higher than BLIM; RECOGNISING that after 5 years of implementation of the interim harvest control rule it is advisable to promote the testing of further refinements that will allow testing tradeoff of alternative Management Procedures with finer steps both for fishing mortality and biomass also including levels above those providing MSY; NOTING the importance of identifying exceptional circumstances that would result in suspending or modifying the application of the HCR; FURTHER NOTING that the SCRS is in the process of developing another MSE framework that may not be available before 2026; AWARE that the application of the HCR in 2020 resulted in a TAC increase and that, under the difficult circumstances facing the organization last year, it was agreed to apply the increase on a pro -rata basis to the catch and other limits, but that this approach did not establish a precedent; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: PART I GENERAL PROVISIONS 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) whose vessels fish North Atlantic albacore in the Convention area shall implement the following conservation and fishery management measures for North Atlantic albacore tuna, which include the Management Procedure (MP) set out in Annex 1 for establishing annual Total Allowable Catches. Management objectives 2. The management objectives for the Northern Atlantic albacore stock are: (a) to maintain the stock in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot, with at least a 60% probability, while maximizing long-term yield from the fishery, and (b) where the spawning stock biomass (SSB) has been assessed by the SCRS as below the level capable of producing MSY (SSB MSY), to rebuild SSB to or above SSB MSY, with at least a 60% probability, and within as short a time as possible, while maximizing average catch and minimizing inter-annual fluctuations in TAC levels. PART II MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE AND EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES 3. The components of the MP are set out in Annex 1 and related Appendices therein. 4. The SCRS shall assess the occurrence of exceptional circumstances (ECs) and the Commission shall act in accordance with the Exceptional Circumstances Protocol sets out in Annex 2. 90 PART III CATCH LIMITS Total Allowable Catch and catch limits 5. The procedure for the establishment of the 3-year constant annual TAC is set out in Annex 3. 6. Pursuant to the application of the procedures established in Annex 1 and Annex 3, constant annual TAC of 37,801 t is established for the management period 2022 -2023. This annual TAC shall be allocated as follows: CPC Quota (t) for the period 2022-2023 European Union 29,095.1 Chinese Taipei 4,416.9 United States 711.5 Venezuela 337.5 * Transfers: - The European Union is authorized to transfer 442.25 t from its quota in 2022 and 2023 to the United Kingdom. - Chinese Taipei is authorized to transfer 200 t of North Atlantic albacore to Belize for 2022 and 2023. 7. CPCs other than those mentioned in paragraph 6 shall limit their annual catches to 242 t. 8. By way of derogation from paragraphs 6 and 7, Japan shall endeavor to limit the total weight of its North Atlantic albacore annual catches to a maximum of 4.5% of the weight of its total bigeye tuna longline catch in the Atlantic Ocean in 2022 and 2023. Underage or overage of catch 9. Any unused portion or excess of a CPC’s annual quota/catch limit may be added to/shall be deducted from, according to the case, the respective quota/catch limit during or before the adjustment year, in the following way: Year of Catch Adjustment Year 2019 2021 2020 2022 2021 2023 2022 2024 2023 2025 However, the maximum underage that a CPC may carryover in any given year shall not exceed 25% of its initial catch quota. If, in any year, the combined landings of CPCs exceed the TAC by more than 20%, the Commission will re-evaluate this Recommendation at its next Commission meeting, including taking into account any advice of the SCRS pursuant to its evaluation of the existence of exceptional circumstances as reflected in Annex 2, and may, as appropriate, recommend further measures. PART IV CAPACITY MANAGEMENT MEASURES 10. CPCs fishing for North Atlantic albacore shall limit the fishing capacity of their vessels, excluding recreational vessels, fishing for this stock from 1999 onwards, by limiting the number vessels to the average number of vessels in the period 1993-1995. 11. Paragraph 10 does not apply to CPCs whose average catches are less than 200 t. 91 PART V CONTROL MEASURES Specific authorization to fish for North Atlantic albacore and ICCAT record of vessels 12. CPCs shall issue specific authorizations to vessels 20 meters LOA or greater flying their flag that are authorized to fish North Atlantic albacore in the Convention area. Each CPC shall indicate which of such vessels it has so authorized on its vessel list submitted pursuant to the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 13-13 Concerning the Establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels 20 meters in Length Overall or Greater Authorized to Operate in the Convention Area (Rec. 21-14). Such vessels not entered into this record or entered without the required indication that fishing for North Atlantic albacore is authorized are deemed not to be authorized to fish for, retain on board, transship, transport, transfer, process or land North Atlantic albacore. 13. CPCs may allow bycatch of North Atlantic albacore by vessels not authorized to fish for North Atlantic albacore pursuant to paragraph 12, if the CPC establishes a maximum onboard bycatch limit for such vessels and the bycatch in question is accounted for w ithin the CPC's quota or catch limit. Each CPC shall provide in its Annual Report the maximum bycatch limit it allows for such vessels. That information shall be compiled by the ICCAT Secretariat and made available to CPCs. PART VI FINAL PROVISIONS 14. During 2022-2023, the SCRS should undertake the following analyses to: (a) test further HCRs supporting the management objectives expressed in paragraph 2 above and associated with a range of control parameters wider than those explored for this Management Procedure and namely: FTAR=(0.8; 0.9; 1.0) * FMSY BTHRESH = (0.8; 0.9; 1.0; 1.1; 1.2) * BMSY The remaining control parameters shall remain as indicated by this Recommendation. (b) evaluate the number of Catch per Unit of Effort (CPUE) series that need to be available and the percentage by which catch data are underreported, that would trigger an occurrence of exceptional circumstance. 15. When advising the Commission on the results of the testing requested in paragraphs 14 (a) and (b) the SCRS shall provide performance statistics to support decision -making in accordance with the performance indicators in Annex 4. Where necessary, for ease of communication the SCRS may limit the presentation to the underlined metrics therein. 16. In 2023, the Commission should review the MP established by this Recommendation to consider if any revision to it is needed, including to the HCR specified in Annex 1, taking into account any analyses carried out by the SCRS in accordance with paragraphs 14 and 15. 17. Beginning for the 2024 -2026 management period, the Commission shall adopt a 3-year constant annual TAC. This TAC shall be based on the application of the current MP or possibly an amended MP pursuant to paragraph 16, unless other action is required in accordance with the Exceptional Circumstances Protocol (Annex 2) as set out in paragraph 4. 18. The SCRS shall continue the development of a new MSE framework to support the possible adoption of a new MP by the Commission no later than 2026 and the setting of a TAC for the management period 2027-2030. In this respect, the SCRS is also requested to explore the possibility of defining potential additional CPUE indices, to complement those reported in Appendix A of Annex 1 , as well as to advise on how possible environmental changes will be taken into account in the development of this framework. 92 19. This Recommendation repeals and replaces: - the Recommendation by ICCAT on a Multi -annual Conservation and Management Programme for North Atlantic Albacore (Rec. 16-06), - the Recommendation by ICCAT on a Harvest Control Rule for North Atlantic Albacore Supplementing the Multiannual Conservation and Management Programme, Rec. 16-06 (Rec. 17-04), - the Recommendation by ICCAT Amending the Recommendation 16-06 Establishing a Multi-Annual Conservation and Management Programme for North Atlantic Albacore (Rec. 20-03), - the Recommendation by ICCAT Amending the Recommendation 17-04 on a Harvest Control Rule for North Atlantic Albacore Supplementing the Multi -annual Conservation and Management Programme in Rec. 16-06 (Rec. 20-04). 93 Annex 1 MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE (MP) 1. For the purpose of the MP for North Atlantic albacore, the following reference points are established: a) BTHRESH = BMSY b) BLIM = 0.4*BMSY c) FTAR = 0.8*FMSY d) FMIN= 0.1*FMSY 2. The North Atlantic albacore stock assessment shall be conducted every three (3) years according to the MP model specifications and data inputs as set out in Appendix A below. The next stock assessment shall occur in 2023. 3. The MP shall be applied to set a 3-year constant annual total allowable catch using the following three values estimated from each stock assessment. For each value the median values as reported in the summary table of the SCRS report shall be used: a) The estimate of current stock biomass (BCURR). b) The estimate of the stock biomass at Maximum Sustainable Yield (BMSY). c) The estimate of the fishing mortality at MSY (FMSY). 4. The Harvest Control Rule within the MP shall have the form as set out in Appendix B below and the following control parameters set out in points (a) through (f) below: a) The biomass threshold level (B THRESH) is equal to the biomass able to deliver the maximum sustainable yield (BTHRESH = BMSY). b) A fishing mortality target corresponding to 80% of FMSY (FTAR = 0.8*FMSY) will be applied when the stock status is at, or above, the threshold level (BTHRESH). c) If the current biomass (B CURR) is estimated to be below the threshold level (B THRESH) and higher than B LIM, then fishing mortality will be reduced linearly for the next multiannual management period (FNEXT) on the following basis: 𝐹𝑁𝐸𝑋𝑇 = (𝑎+𝑏∗ 𝐵𝐶𝑈𝑅𝑅 𝐵𝑀𝑆𝑌 )* FMSY = (−0.367+1.167 𝐵𝐶𝑈𝑅𝑅 𝐵𝑀𝑆𝑌)* FMSY where 𝑎=[ 𝐹𝑡𝑎𝑟 𝐹𝑀𝑆𝑌]−[ 𝐹𝑡𝑎𝑟 𝐹𝑀𝑆𝑌−𝐹𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝐹𝑀𝑆𝑌 𝐵𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ 𝐵𝑀𝑆𝑌 −𝐵𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝐵𝑀𝑆𝑌 ]∗ 𝐵𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ 𝐵𝑀𝑆𝑌 = -0.367 b = [ 𝐹𝑡𝑎𝑟 𝐹𝑀𝑆𝑌−𝐹𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝐹𝑀𝑆𝑌 𝐵𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ 𝐵𝑀𝑆𝑌 −𝐵𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝐵𝑀𝑆𝑌 ] = 1.167 d) If the current biomass (BCURR) is estimated to be at, or below, BLIM, then the fishing mortality shall be set at FMIN with a view to ensure a level of catch for scientific monitoring. e) The maximum catch limit (C MAX) recommended is 50,000 t in order to avoid adverse effects of potentially inaccurate stock assessments. f) The maximum change in the catch limit (DMAX) shall not exceed 25% in case of increase or 20% in case of decrease of the previous recommended catch limit when BCURR ≥ BTHRESH. 5. The HCR described in paragraph 4. a) -d) produces a relationship between stock status and fishing mortality as shown in the graph of Appendix B below. The table of Appendix C reports the values of fishing mortality to be applied (FNEXT) for specific values of relative biomass (BCURR/BMSY). 94 Appendix A of Annex 1 Data and stock assessment specifications for the North Atlantic Albacore Management Procedure - CPUE indices and their starting years; where “t” is the year of the Management Procedure iteration for establishing the TAC for years t+1, t+2 and t+3.

Principles of exceptional circumstances The following three general principles should be considered as a signal indicating the possibility that exceptional circumstances (ECs) exist: a) When there is evidence that the stock is in a state not previously considered to be plausible in the context of the management strategy evaluation (MSE); b) When there is evidence that the data required to apply the management procedure (MP) are not available or are no longer appropriate; and/or, c) When there is evidence that total catch is above the TAC set using the MP. 2. Indicators for ECs In light of the principles specified in Section 1, the SCRS should use the following table to judge whether ECs exist. Triggering an EC does not immediately result in TAC advice from the MP being rescinded ; rather, it means that the SCRS needs to examine the indicators and determine if a change in advice is warranted. 98 Principle Indicator Criterion Frequency of evaluation of Exceptional Circumstances a. Stock dynamics Relative stock biomass (B/BMSY)27F 1 Falls outside the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile range of values in any year from the OMs used in the MSE when the accepted MP was tested Each benchmark stock assessment (every 6-7 years) Relative fishing mortality (F/FMSY)1 Growth28F 2 Are substantially different from the values from the OMs used in the MSE when the accepted MP was tested After completion, presentation, and acceptance by the SCRS of a study as the new reference Maturity2 Natural mortality2 CPUE29F 3 Falls outside the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile range of values in any year from the OMs used in the MSE when the accepted MP was tested Annually b. Application of the MP CPUE If two or more series have not been updated for two or more years. If two or more series are determined to no longer reflect abundance Each MP iteration (every 3 years) Catch Catch data are unavailable or substantially unreported Each MP iteration (every 3 years) Relative stock biomass (B/BMSY)30F 4 Values from the production model in an iteration of the MP fall outside the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile range of values in any year produced by the accepted MP’s production model during MSE testing Each MP iteration (every 3 years) Relative fishing mortality (F/FMSY)4 c. Implementation of the TAC Catch Total catch is above by more than 20% the TAC set using the MP Annually 1 B/BMSY and F/FMSY: In every benchmark assessment, the estimated B/BMSY and F/FMSY trajectories are plotted (overlaid) on top of those used in the OMs (Figures 19 and 20 of the MSE Consolidated document (Merino et al . 2020)). The SCRS would compare the new estimated stock trajectory with the potential realities of the stock contemplated in the OMs. If the new trend falls within t he trends considered in the OMs, there is no EC. The criteria, as written, implies that if in a single year, relative biomass or fishing mortality falls outside of the values considered in the OMs, then EC would be identified by the SCRS. 2 Growth, Maturity and Natural Mortality values as in Consolidated document (Merino et al. 2020). 3 CPUE (for the principle of stock dynamics only): Every year the SCRS would update the standardized CPUEs and plot the new time series on top of those used in the MSE (Figure 23 of the MSE Consolidated document (Merino et al. 2020)). The trend should be within the values considered in the OMs for every single year. 4 B/BMSY and F/FMSY: Every 3 years (MP iteration), the relative B and F series estimated by the MP is plotted (overlaid), on top of those estimated by the MP in the iterations of the MSE (Figures 21-22 of the MSE Consolidated document (Merino et al . 2020)). The comparison is the “estimated trajectories” to the “estimated trajectories considered in the MSE”. The trend should be within the values considered in the OMs for every single year, and, if not, EC would be identified by the SCRS. Merino G., Kell L.T., Arrizabalaga H., Santiago J. 2020.

Actions to be taken in light of ECs If the SCRS determines that an EC exists that precludes the application of the MP or makes the application of the MP or the implementation of its results unadvisable based on the principles outlined in Section 1, the SCRS shall evaluate the nature of the EC and advise the Commission on: (A) alternative management options for the coming fishing year aimed at ensuring, at a minimum, stability in the status of the stock, including the implications of: (i) maintaining the status quo total allowable catch (TAC), (ii) reducing the TAC by 20% or another appropriate percentage, in particular in light of indications of stock decline, and (iii) any other appropriate conservation and management actions; (B) whether the existing MP can and should be adjusted or whether development of a new MP is required; and (C) whether a stock assessment is needed for providing management advice in the interim. Based on the SCRS advice, the Commission shall decide on the alternative management action(s) to be taken. Unless the SCRS advises that there is a sufficient scientific basis to deviate, the Commission shall reduce the TAC of North Atlantic albacore by 20% for the following year. In addition, as needed and appropriate, the SCRS shall conduct a new stock assessment and/or provide advice on new candidate MPs as soon as possible. 100 See the flowchart below for a schematic representation of the above process: If ECs exist If no ECs exist The TAC calculated by the MP continues to be valid (in years 1-3) and the MP continues to be applied in year 3 to calculate the TAC for the next three-year management period The SCRS shall advise the Commission on: (A) Alternative management options for the coming fishing year aimed at ensuring, at a minimum, stability in the status of the stock, including the implications of: (i) maintaining the status quo total allowable catch (TAC); (ii) reducing the TAC by 20% or another appropriate percentage, in particular in light of indications of stock decline; and (iii) any other appropriate conservation and management actions; (B) whether the existing MP can and should be adjusted or whether development of a new MP is required; and (C) whether a stock assessment is needed for providing management advice in the interim. Based on the SCRS advice, the Commission shall decide on the alternative management action(s) to be taken. Unless the SCRS advises that there is a sufficient scientific basis to deviate, the Commission shall reduce the TAC by 20% for the following year. In addition, as needed and appropriate, the SCRS shall conduct a new stock assessment and/or provide advice on new candidate MPs as soon as possible. SCRS determines that EC precludes the application of the MP or makes the application of the MP or the implementation of its results (i.e. TAC) unadvisable SCRS determines that ECs do not preclude the application of the MP and implementation of its results (i.e. TAC). The SCRS shall check if ECs exist using the indicators specified in the table in Section 2 above and according to the indicated frequency. Year 1 & 2: 1. check for new studies of growth, maturity, and natural mortality; 2. update CPUE indices; 3. update catch. - checking that all three of these are within the range of values specified in the table in Section 2 above. Year 3: 1. check that all datasets required in running the MP are available 2. re-run MP and check stock biomass and fishing mortality resulting from the MP’s production model is within the 2.5% to 97.5% percentile range of values that occurred in the production model results when the accepted MP was tested by MSE; 3. same checks done in Year 1 & 2. Any year: - if a stock assessment has been conducted by the SCRS, check that the stock biomass and fishing mortality resulting from the stock assessment are within the 2.5% to 97.5% percentile range of values from the OMs used in the MSE when the accepted MP was tested. 101 Annex 3 Procedure to establish the Total Allowable Catch for each management period The 3-year constant annual TAC shall be set as follows on the basis of reference points and management procedure set in Annex 1 above: (a) if the current biomass (B CURR) is estimated to be at, or above, the threshold biomass (i.e., B CURR ≥ BMSY), then the catch limit shall be set at: 1. TAC = FTAR * BCURR (b) if the current biomass (B CURR) is estimated to be below the threshold biomass but greater than BLIM (i.e., BCURR > 0.4*BMSY), then the catch limit shall be set at 1. TAC = FNEXT * BCURR Values for F NEXT are reported in Appendix C of Annex 1 and can also be calculated through the formula reported in paragraph 4.c therein. (c) if the current biomass (BCURR) is estimated to be at, or below, the BLIM (i.e., BCURR ≤ 0.4*BMSY), then the catch limit shall be set at: 1. TAC = FMIN * BCURR with a view to ensure a level of catch for scientific monitoring. Where this occurs, the Commission shall immediately adopt severe management actions in order to reduce the fishing mortality rate to FMIN, including measures to reduce the fishery to a level that would not exceed this level and to implement a scientific monitoring quota to be able to evaluate the stock status. The Commission shall not consider re-opening the fishery beyond this level until the current biomass (BCURR) exceeds BLIM with a high probability. Furthermore, before reopening the fishery beyond this level, the Commission shall develop a rebuilding programme in order to ensure that the stock returns to the green quadrant of the Kobe plot consistent with the terms of the Recommendation by ICCAT on the Principles of Decision Making for ICCAT Conservation and Management Measures (Rec. 11-13). (d) the catch limit resulting from the above calculations shall be below the maximum catch limit (CMAX) as reported in paragraph 4(e) of Annex 1 and shall not increase by more than 25% or decrease by more than 20% from the previous catch limit except when BCURR < BTHRESH or unless otherwise required pursuant to an agreed management response when exceptional circumstances are determined to have occurred by the SCRS pursuant to Annex 2 of this Recommendation. (e) in the case of subparagraph (c) above, the catch limit could be set at a level lower than F MIN * BCURR if the SCRS considers it sufficient to ensure a level of catch proper for scientific monitoring. 102 Annex 4 Performance metrics to be provided by SCRS to support decision-making Underlined bold metrics are the subset to be regularly provided for easy communication.

The biomass, however, may react quickly to the lowering of F and increase rapidly so that one or more of the three years of the cycle will have B>B LIM. 4 Useful in the absence of TAC-related constraints in the harvest control rule. 5 Positive and negative changes to be reported separately. 6 Positive and negative changes to be reported separately. 103 22-06 ALB RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON THE SOUTHERN ATLANTIC ALBACORE CATCH LIMITS FOR THE PERIOD 2023-2026 (Entry into force 23 June 2023) NOTING the conclusions of the 2020 SCRS Report, that the southern Atlantic albacore stock is, most probably, not overfished and overfishing is not occurring; FURTHER NOTING that the SCRS concluded that southern Atlantic albacore stock projections at a constant catch level of 28,000 t would result in an 83% probability of being in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot by 2033; ACKNOWLEDGING that the southern Atlantic albacore catches have been well below the current Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of 24,000 t, except for 2021; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that total annual declared catches have been considerably lower than Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY); RECOGNISING the objective of the Convention is to maintain populations at levels that will support maximum sustainable catch (usually referred to MSY); FURTHER RECOGNISING the interests of developing coastal States to develop their fishing opportunities; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. The annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for albacore caught in the Atlantic Ocean south of 5ºN shall be 28,000 t for the period 2023-2026. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, should the total reported southern Atlantic albacore catches in 2022, as reported to the 2023 ICCAT meeting, exceed 28,000 t, the TAC for 2024 shall be reduced by the full amount of the 2022 catch in excess of 28,000 t. 3. The annual catch limits for southern Atlantic albacore shall be as follows: a) Catch limits (t)* Angola 60 Belize 300 Brazil 2,600 China 240 Chinese Taipei 10,340 Côte d’Ivoire 120 Curaçao 60 European Union 1,765 Japan 1,630 Korea 170 Namibia 4,320 South Africa 5,280 St Vincent and Grenadines 170 United Kingdom1 120 Uruguay 530 Philippines 30 * The following annual transfers of catch limits shall be authorized: From Brazil to Japan: 100 t in 2023-2026 From Uruguay to Japan: 100 t in 2023-2026 From South Africa to Japan: 100 t in 2023-2026 1 The United Kingdom became a member of ICCAT in 2020 and it includes the Overseas Territories of the United Kingdom. 104 b) All other CPCs not listed above shall limit their catches to 30 t. c) The catch limits described in this Recommendation do not constitute long term rights and are without prejudice to any future process of allocation. 4. Any unused portion or excess of the individual annual catch limits may be added to/shall be deducted from, according to the case, the respective catch limit during or before the adjustment year, in the following way for southern Atlantic albacore: a) Underages of the annual quota may be added to the respective quota for each CPC, to the maximum limit of 25% of their original quota, in the following way: Year of catch Adjustment year 2022 2024 2023 2025 2024 2026 2025 2027 2026 2028 b) By the time of the Commission Meeting, those CPCs with underages in the previous year shall inform the amount of their underage they intend to use in the following year. The total underage from the TAC from one given year, minus the underages to be used by those CPCs wishing to do so, may be shared among those CPCs wishing to complement their quota, irrespective to their underages, to the limit of 25% of their original quota. c) In the case the total amount of underages requested by all CPCs exceeds the total amount made available under this mechanism, the amount of underages shall be shared pro rata among those CPCs requesting complementation of their quotas, in the proportion of their original quotas. d) In respect of the 2022 catches and TAC, underages may only be used to the extent of the available underage of total TAC. e) The carry -over of underages is only applicable to those CPCs specifically referred to in paragraph 3 a). f) In respect of South Africa, Brazil and Uruguay, should any of these CPCs reach their individual catch limits by 31 December, and any other aforementioned CPCs have underage available within the same year, then any or all of their underage available shall automatically transfer, up to a maximum of 1,000 t collectively, in proportion to their respective original quotas to any of the three CPCs which has reached its catch limit for that year, on condition that such transfer of underage does not prejudice the t ransferring CPCs respective maximum underage allowance as set out in paragraph 4 b). Such transfers shall be reported in CPC Compliance Reporting Tables and be communicated to all CPCs through an ICCAT Circular. 5. Should a given CPC exceed its quota, the over-catch must be deducted from its original quota by 100% of the total exceeded amount in accordance with the schedule in paragraph 4 and that CPC will be prohibited of requesting any underages made available under the present mechanism in the following year. 6. Notwithstanding the Recommendation by ICCAT regarding the temporary adjustment of quotas (Rec. 01-12), all CPCs specifically referred to in paragraph 3 a) may transfer a portion of their quota to another CPC subject to both CPCs agreeing and providing prior notification to the ICCAT Secretariat in terms of the quantity to be transferred. The Secretariat shall disseminate this notification to all CPCs. 105 7. Those CPCs that are catching southern Atlantic albacore, shall immediately improve their catch reporting systems to ensure the reporting of accurate and validated southern Atlantic albacore catch and effort data to ICCAT in full accordance with the ICCAT r equirements for provision of Task 1 and Task 2 catch, effort and size data. In addition, port states CPCs in the South Atlantic shall report the results of their port inspections to the ICCAT Secretariat in accordance with the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 18-09 on Port State measures to prevent, deter, and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (Rec. 23-17). The ICCAT Secretariat shall forward the reports to the flag CPC. 8. The next stock assessment of southern Atlantic albacore shall be conducted in 2026. Scientists of entities actively fishing for southern Atlantic albacore are strongly encouraged to analyse their fisheries data and to participate in the 2026 assessment. 9. All aspects of the southern Atlantic albacore catch limit and sharing arrangement shall be reviewed and revised at the 2026 ICCAT Commission meeting, taking account of the results of the updated southern Atlantic albacore stock assessment to be conducted in 2026. This review and revision shall also address any over-harvests made in excess of the 2023 to 2026 TAC. 10. CPCs shall issue specific authorizations to vessels 20 meters LOA or greater flying their flag that are authorized to fish southern Atlantic albacore in the Convention area. Each CPC shall indicate which of such vessels it has so authorized on its vessel list submitted pursuant to the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning the establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels 20 meters in length overall or greater authorized to operate in the Convention area (Rec. 21-14). Such vessels not entered into this record or entered without the required indication that fishing southern Atlantic albacore is authorized are deemed not to be authorized to fish for, retain on board, tranship, transport, transfer, process or land southern Atlantic albacore. 11. CPCs may allow bycatch of southern Atlantic albacore by vessels not authorized to fish southern Atlantic albacore pursuant to paragraph 10 only, if the CPC establishes a maximum per trip onboard bycatch limit of no more than 5% for such vessels and the byc atch is accounted for within the CPC’s catch limit. Each CPC shall provide in its Annual Report the maximum per trip bycatch limit it allows for such vessels and the total amount of southern Atlantic albacore harvested as bycatch. That information shall be compiled by the ICCAT Secretariat and made available to CPCs. 12. The Recommendation repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT on the southern albacore catch limits for the period 2017 to 2020 (Rec. 16-07) and further repeals and replaces the Supplemental Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 16-07 on South Atlantic albacore catch limits for the period 2017-2020 (Rec. 21-05). 106 23-05 ALB RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT AMENDING THE RECOMMENDATION 21-04 ON CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES, INCLUDING A MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE AND EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES PROTOCOL, FOR NORTH ATLANTIC ALBACORE (Entry into force 18 June 2024) NOTING that in 2021, the Commission adopted a management procedure (MP), Recommendation 21-04, which sets the management procedure to achieve the management objective of maintaining the stock in the green area of the Kobe plot with at least a 60% probability whi le maximizing long-term yield; FURTHER NOTING that the current MP integrates a Harvest Control Rule (HCR) to set total allowable catches (TACs) every three years. The current three -year period ends by the end of 2023, and therefore, a new three-year TAC cycle for 2024-2026 must be established; CONSIDERING that the SCRS assessed the current management procedure, which results in a TAC of 47,251 t for 2024 -2026. Any of the MP variants requested in Recommendation 21 -04 would result in the same TAC due to the maximum TAC increase of 25%, which can be sustained in the near term; FURTHER CONSIDERING that no exceptional circumstances have been detected that would preclude the application of the MP; AWARE that in 2020, it was agreed to apply the TAC increase on a pro-rata basis to the catch and other limits. This approach will be followed again; however, it shall not establish a precedent; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Paragraph 6, 7, 8, and 9 of Recommendation 21-04 shall be amended as follows: “6. Pursuant to the application of the procedures established in Annex 1 and Annex 3, a constant annual TAC of 47,251 t is established for the management period 2024 -2026. This annual TAC shall be allocated as follows: CPC Quota (t) for the period 2024-2026 European Union 35,815.9 Chinese Taipei 5,521.1 United States 889.4 United Kingdom* 752.8 Venezuela 421.9 * This includes 200 t exclusively for catches in respect of the United Kingdom’s Overseas Territories covered by the ICCAT Convention. Transfers: - Chinese Taipei is authorized to transfer 200 t of North Atlantic albacore to Belize for 2024, 2025 and 2026. 7. CPCs other than those mentioned in paragraph 6 shall limit their annual catches to 302 t. 8. By way of derogation from paragraphs 6 and 7, Japan shall endeavor to limit the total weight of its North Atlantic albacore annual catches to a maximum of 4.5% of the weight of its total bigeye tuna longline catch in the Atlantic Ocean in 2024, 2025 and 2026. 107 9. Any unused portion or excess of a CPC’s annual quota/catch limit may be added to/shall be deducted from, according to the case, the respective quota/catch limit during or before the adjustment year, in the following way: Year of Catch Adjustment Year 2022 2024 2023 2025 2024 2026 2025 2027 2026 2028 However, the maximum underage that a CPC may carryover in any given year shall not exceed 25% of its initial catch quota. If, in any year, the combined landings of CPCs exceed the TAC by more than 20%, the Commission will re-evaluate this Recommendation at its next Commission meeting, including taking into account any advice of the SCRS pursuant to its evaluation of the existence of exceptional circumstances as reflected in Annex 2, and may, as appropriate, recommend further measures.” 108 24-08 ALB RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO AMEND RECOMMENDATION 22-05 TO ESTABLISH A REBUILDING PLAN FOR MEDITERRANEAN ALBACORE (Entry into force 16 June 2025) RECALLING the 2021 Recommendation by ICCAT to establish a rebuilding plan for Mediterranean albacore (Rec. 21-06); NOTING the provisions of the Recommendation by ICCAT on the principles of decision making for conservation and management measures (Rec. 11-13) and the need to rebuild the stock and to reduce the fishing mortality for stocks overfished and subject to overfishing; CONSIDERING that the 2021 stock assessment of the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) concluded that the Mediterranean albacore stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring, and recommended a level of catch of 2,500 t to meet the Convention management objective to allow the biomass to recover to the BMSY level with 60% probability by 2034; ACKNOWLEDGING that following the 2021 stock assessment for Mediterranean albacore, the SCRS noted in its advice that there is high uncertainty regarding the characterization of stock status, in particular for fishing mortality; HIGHLIGHTING that, according to the latest scientific advice, and consistent with the precautionary approach, the SCRS recommends preventing an increase of catches; CONSIDERING that to prevent an increase of the fishing effort and of catches it is important to ensure that the fishing capacity does not increase; CONSIDERING that the obligation set out in paragraph 12 of Recommendation by ICCAT replacing the Recommendation 13 -04 and establishing a Multi -annual Recovery Plan for Mediterranean Swordfish (Rec. 16-05) introducing a closure period from 1 October to 30 November for the longline fisheries targeting Mediterranean albacore ( Thunnus alalunga ), with the aim of protecting juveniles of Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius), should continue to be implemented by all CPCs; ACKNOWLEDGING that paragraph 11 of ICCAT Recommendation 16 -05 on Mediterranean swordfish foresees two alternative closure periods for this fishery and these closures also affect albacore fisheries in the Mediterranean; ACKNOWLEDGING the socio-economic dimension of small-scale Mediterranean fisheries and the need for a gradual approach and flexibility in managing these fisheries; RECALLING the importance that all fleets participating in Mediterranean albacore fisheries submit the required data (catch, effort and catch-at-size) on their fisheries for transmission to the SCRS; CONSIDERING the outcome of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Mediterranean albacore meeting held online on 9-10 February 2022; FURTHER CONSIDERING the trilateral discussions between European Union, Egypt and Türkiye at the 2022 ICCAT Annual Meeting; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that, due to limited data following the adoption of the recovery plan, there is insufficient information available to assess the effectiveness of the current rebuilding plan and for the SCRS to advise on any necessary adjustments; 109 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNA (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties, Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereafter referred to as CPCs) whose vessels have been actively fishing for albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) in the Mediterranean shall implement a 15-year rebuilding plan starting in 2022 and continuing through 2036 with the goal of achieving BMSY with at least 60% probability. 2. For 2025 and 2026, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) shall be set at 2,500 t for albacore tuna ( Thunnus alalunga) in the Mediterranean. 3. For 2025 and 2026, the following quotas shall be allocated: CPC Quota (t) EU 2,089.93 Egypt 150.27 Libya 23 Morocco 10 Syria 1.8 Tü¨ rkiye (*) 225 Total 2,500 (*) Türkiye transfers to EU any part of the unused quota up to maximum of 75 t. 4. Each CPC shall limit the number of their fishing vessels authorised to fish for Mediterranean albacore to the number of vessels that were authorized to fish for Mediterranean albacore in 2017 under paragraph 28 of Recommendation 16-05; alternatively, in 2018 for CPCs which started to issue licenses for their fishing vessels in 2018 following the adoption of Recommendation 17 -05. The CPCs shall communicate to the Commission, by 15 January 2022, the year of reference applying to them. CPCs, which used 2017 as the year of reference, may apply a tolerance of 10% to this capacity limit. 5. At the latest on the 15 March of each year, CPCs shall provide to the ICCAT Secretariat the list of all catching vessels authorized to fish actively for Mediterranean albacore. CPCs shall provide this list according to the format set out in the Guidelines for submitting data and information required by ICCAT. If needed, CPCs shall be able to modify this list during the year by providing an updated list to the ICCAT Secretariat. 6. CPCs shall provide to the ICCAT Secretariat the list of all sport and recreational vessels authorized to catch albacore in the Mediterranean Sea, at least 15 days before the exercise of the activities. Vessels not introduced on this list shall not be authorized to catch Mediterranean albacore. 7. CPCs shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the catch and retention on board, transshipment or landing of more than three Mediterranean albacore specimens per vessel per day for sport and recreational fisheries. 8. The marketing of Mediterranean albacore caught in sport and recreational fishing shall be prohibited. 9. Without prejudice to the obligation set out in paragraph 12 of Rec. 16-05, Mediterranean albacore shall not be caught (either as a targeted species or as bycatch), retained on board, transhipped or landed during either: a) the period from 1 October to 30 November and during an additional period of one month between 15 February and 31 March; 110 b) or, alternatively, during the period from 1 January to 31 March each year. The CPCs shall communicate to the Commission, by 15 January 2022, the closure periods of their choice. 10. CPCs shall monitor the Mediterranean albacore stock and shall submit to the Commission, at least two months before the Annual Meeting of the Commission, all relevant scientific information on catch, size and age at maturity, habitat, impact of longline fisherie s in terms of catch composition, CPUE series, size distribution of the catches, and monthly estimation of spawner and recruit proportion in the catches. These data shall be submitted to the SCRS in the format required by ICCAT. 11. In 2026, or in any subsequent year identified by the SCRS in 2025 due to data limitations that prevent it from proceeding with its work, the SCRS shall provide an updated assessment of the state of the stock on the basis of the most recent data available. It shall assess the effectiveness of this rebuilding plan and provide advice on possible amendments to the various measures within this plan. The SCRS shall advise the Commission on the appropriate characteristics of the fishing gear, the closure period in paragraph 9, as well as the minimum size to be implemented for Mediterranean albacore. 12. By the end of 2026, or any year thereafter as per paragraph 11, based on this scientific advice, ICCAT shall adopt, where necessary to comply with the management objectives, amendments to the management framework for Mediterranean albacore, including the revi sion of the catch limits and alternative management scenarios. 13. CPCs without quota allocations, in particular Tunisia and Algeria, whose vessels are deemed to take Mediterranean albacore as bycatch in their fisheries, are required to submit their annual catch data in accordance with SCRS requirements. Those CPCs shall take measures to ensure that these bycatches of Mediterranean albacore in the Mediterranean swordfish longline fisheries do not exceed 10% of the total catches per vessel and fishing trip. When assessing the effectiveness of this rebuilding plan, the SCRS shall take into consideration the volume of Mediterranean albacore bycatch and provide scientific advice taking into account these bycatches. 14. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article VIII, paragraph 2 of the Convention, CPCs are strongly encouraged to implement, in accordance with their regulatory procedures, this Recommendation as soon as possible and before the date of its entry into force. 15. This R ecommendation repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 21-06 to establish a rebuilding plan for Mediterranean albacore (Rec. 22-05). 111 24-09 ALB RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ON DEVELOPMENT OF INITIAL OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES FOR SOUTHERN ATLANTIC ALBACORE (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 16 December 2024) RECALLING the intent of the Commission to adopt management procedures (MPs) tested through management strategy evaluation (MSE 1) to manage fisheries more effectively in the face of identified uncertainties; RECALLING the application of the precautionary approach in accordance with relevant international standards as established in the Resolution by ICCAT concerning the use of a precautionary approach in implementing ICCAT conservation and management measures (Res. 15-12); TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the efforts to sustainably manage the southern Atlantic albacore stock, consistent with the objectives of the Convention and the Recommendation by ICCAT on the principles of decision making for ICCAT conservation and management measures (Rec. 11-13); NOTING the conclusions of the 2020 stock assessment conducted by the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS), which indicated that the southern Atlantic albacore stock is most likely located in the green area of the Kobe plot, indicating that the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring; NOTING that the objective of the Convention is to maintain populations of tuna and tuna-like species at levels that will support maximum sustainable catch (usually referred to as Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)); UNDERSTANDING that conceptual objectives are high -level aspirational objectives that verbalize a desired generic goal without including specifics on a measurable target or timeframe for achievement, while operational objectives are a key foundational component of any MSE and provide specific and measurable targets, with associated likelihoods of achieving those targets over determined timeframes; ACKNOWLEDGING the substantial progress made on the MSE work for those priority species identified in the Recommendation by ICCAT on the development of Harvest Control Rules and of Management Strategy Evaluation (Rec. 15-07); CONSIDERING that the Commission desires to adopt an MP for southern Atlantic albacore no later than 2029; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. Management objectives should be established for southern Atlantic albacore tuna consistent with the Convention’s objective: to maintain populations at or above levels that will support maximum sustainable catch (usually referred to as MSY). 2. To facilitate development of an MSE for southern Atlantic albacore, the following initial operational management objectives should be considered: a. Stock Status - The stock should have a 60% or greater probability of occurring in the green quadrant of the Kobe matrix over a 30-year projection period; 1 The SCRS should use 40% of the spawning stock biomass at Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) as the interim BLIM for southern Atlantic albacore tuna, or advise on a different value, if appropriate. 112 b. Safety - There should be no greater than 15% probability of the stock falling below BLIM1 at any point during the 30-year projection period; c. Yield - Maximize overall catch levels; and d. Stability - Any changes in total allowable catch (TAC) between management periods should be 20% or less.2 3. The SCRS should use a 3-year management cycle for initial development of the MSE. 4. The initial operational management objectives (paragraph 2) may be rejected, modified, or supplemented, as appropriate, by Panel 3, and these initial management objectives will be forwarded to the SCRS Albacore Species Group for review and evaluation through the MSE process. 5. Panel 3 will provide its recommendations for final management objectives for southern Atlantic albacore, considering the SCRS input, to the Commission for consideration as part of the selection of a management procedure no later than at its 2029 Annual Meeting. 2 Asymmetric stability limits may be evaluated in the MSE. 113 06-08 BFT RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ON FISHING BLUEFIN TUNA IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 14 December 2006) ACKNOWLEDGING continuing concern about the possible adverse effect of a large shift of fishing effort in the Atlantic on future bluefin tuna conservation programs, NOTING the SCRS’ concern about issues of mixing identified in previous SCRS documents, NOTING there is strong evidence of mixing in the entire Atlantic, including Central area, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: Contracting Parties, Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) should not increase their catch by large-scale tuna longline vessels from the 1999/2000 level in the area north of 10ºN, and between 30ºW and 45ºW. 114 08-06 BFT RESOLUTION BY ICCAT CONCERNING ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON STOCK ORIGIN AND MIXING (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 18 December 2008) RECALLING the 2001 Resolution by ICCAT regarding the SCRS Mixing Report on Atlantic Bluefin Tuna [Res. 01 -09] calling on Contracting Parties, Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities, and Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as “CPCs”) to conduct scientific research throughout the Atlantic and Mediterranean that would contribute to the better understanding of bluefin tuna movement patterns; CONSIDERING that the uncertainty associated with the rates of stock mixing in the different fisheries throughout the Atlantic highlights the need for sound management, based on science, in both the west Atlantic and the east Atlantic and Mediterranean; RECOGNIZING that the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) has noted the need to integrate recent and anticipated advances in otolith microconstituent analyses, age determination, archival tagging and genetics into the assessment and management evaluation processes; FURTHER RECOGNIZING that the SCRS has advised in its 2008 report that otolith microconstituent data can be very useful to determine stock origin with relatively high accuracy, and thus could be a key factor to improve the ability to conduct mixing analyses; that representative samples need to be collected from all major fisheries, in all areas; and that added value would be obtained if genetic samples were also collected from the same fish, which could potentially result in more accurate and less expensive tests for stock origin; ACKNOWLEDGING the importance of also identifying existing collections of otoliths collected in historical time periods (e.g., the 1970s and 1980s) in order to understand how the stock origin proportions in the catch may have changed and improve mixing analyses; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. The CPCs, whether operating in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean or western Atlantic fishery, should collect otoliths for microconstituent analysis and tissue samples for genetic studies and cooperate in research, including comprehensive archival and conventional tagging studies, that will help resolve issues associated with population structure, spawning site fidelity, and spatial dynamics (including stock mixing). Collection of biological samples should be representative of the fishery and consistent with SCRS guidance and protocols. 2. In support of this work, a CPC with a bluefin tuna quota allocation should consider making a portion of its bluefin tuna quota available for research consistent with domestic obligations, conservation considerations, and a bona fide research plan. 3. CPCs, whether operating in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean or western Atlantic fishery, are also encouraged to identify to the SCRS any existing collections of otoliths and other biological samples from historical periods in order to improve mixing analyses. 4. CPCs should encourage their scientists to contact industry and trade association groups in order to obtain representative samples from the various fisheries. 115 11-06 BFT RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT CONCERNING THE ATLANTIC-WIDE RESEARCH PROGRAMME FOR BLUEFIN TUNA (GBYP) (Entry into force: 7 June 2012) RECALLING the Commission decision in 2008 to adopt the Atlantic-wide Research Programme for the Bluefin Tuna (GBYP), endorsing the proposal made by the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS). RECALLING the Commission decision in 2009 to initiate the Atlantic -wide Research Programme for Bluefin Tuna (GBYP), endorsing the reviewed and updated SCRS proposal. RECALLING also the Resolution by ICCAT concerning Atlantic bluefin tuna scientific research on stock origin and mixing (Res. 08-06). RECOGNIZING that the research results obtained by GBYP in the initial two phases of the programme provided a large amount of historical and new data on bluefin tuna, including promising results on fishery- independent data obtained by aerial survey on bluefin tuna spawning aggregations. FURTHER RECOGNIZING that the initial experience showed serious limits caused by the absence of specific provision for the research, particularly important after the adoption and enforcement of the ICCAT Rec. 08-05, Rec.09-06 and Rec. 10-04. CONSIDERING that the current limits are able to impede the regular activity of the GBYP as they have been proposed by the SCRS and endorsed by the Commission, with particular reference to the aerial survey on spawning aggregations, the biological and genetic sampling and the tagging activities. FURTHER CONSIDERING that similar problems encountered by a previous ICCAT programme (BYP) were resolved by the Supplemental Recommendation by ICCAT on Bluefin Tuna Research in the Central North Atlantic Ocean (Rec. 01-08). RECOGNIZING that the SCRS, in its 2011 Report, has recommended that the Commission should adopt specific provisions for allowing the regular research activity of GBYP. ACKNOWLEDGING the importance of conducting the GBYP research as it was requested by the Commission under a clear legal framework. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. The Contracting Parties, Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as CPCs) shall provide the maximum assistance to ICCAT-GBYP for permits to operate in their relevant maritime areas or airspaces over marine zones which are under their jurisdiction, following the conditions of domestic rules and legislation of each concerned CPC on these issues. 2. The CPCs shall provide ICCAT-GBYP all the necessary contacts at the national level to assist in carrying out the research activities. 3. Scientific institutions and entities participating in the ICCAT -GBYP research activities are exempt from the Commission’s conservation measures on bluefin tuna for up to a maximum of an overall amount of 20 metric tons of bluefin tuna annually (“Research Mortality Allowance” or “RMA”) taken or killed incidentally during the GBYP biological and genetic sampling programme or the tagging activities, as approved by the SCRS and endorsed by the Commission. These tunas cannot be sold for commercial purposes and shall be reported in detail to ICCAT and SCRS at the end of each Phase of GBYP, according to specific rules that will be established by the ICCAT Secretariat and attached to the research contracts. 4. Scientific institutions and entities participating in the ICCAT -GBYP scientific research activities, as designated, identified and authorized by the ICCAT -GBYP Coordination, are exempt from the Commission’s conservation measures on bluefin tuna and particularly from the minimum size limit, the limit concerning the use of any fishing gear or tool and the fishery closures, for allowing the GBYP scientific research activities to be conducted at any time of the year, with any gear and for sampling any size of b luefin tuna, according to the annual programme approved by the SCRS and endorsed by the Commission. 5. All CPCs undertake to consider providing the necessary funding or other logistical support in order to conduct this critical scientific endeavor. 116 16-24 BFT GUIDELINES FOR PREPARING THE EASTERN ATLANTIC AND MEDITERRANEAN BLUEFIN TUNA FISHING, INSPECTION AND CAPACITY MANAGEMENT PLANS In accordance with the Recommendation by ICCAT Amending the Recommendation 13 -07 by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-annual Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean [Rec. 14- 04]7F 1 each Contracting Party and Cooperating non -Contracting Party, Entity or Fishing Entity (hereinafter referred to as CPC) which has eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna quota submits a fishing, inspection and capacity management plan.

A pilot project for the short-term live storage of bluefin tuna is authorized. 2. Contracting Parties and Cooperating Non-contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as CPCs) whose vessels have been actively fishing for bluefin tuna north of 56°N, may conduct short-term live storage of bluefin tuna. 3. The objectives of short-term live storage of bluefin tuna are to maintain a high-quality product and to ensure that distribution of the fish can occur in a way that does not flood the market. 4. Research conducted as part of the pilot project should aim to provide answers to key questions related to short-term live storage of bluefin tuna, including, but not limited to, the following: − fish behavior − estimate the weight of bluefin tuna at the time of catch and caging − whether feeding is needed to ensure animal health and, if so, how to avoid fattening the bluefin tuna − extent of mortality and causes − meat quality − how to ensure traceability is ensured consistent with the requirements of the BCD program, including exploring the use of tagging − harvesting processes 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 22-16 and 24-16. 2 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations. 21-19 and 23-21. 120 − marketing questions 5. CPCs who wish to engage in the pilot project on short-term live storage of bluefin tuna should identify and describe the activity in their annual fishing plan, in accordance with the multi-annual conservation and management plan for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna (Rec. 22-08, paragraph 10). The allocation from the CPC’s national quota to the pilot project should be specified in the annual fishing plan and should be on a limited scale and approved by Panel 2. This plan should also include details of the control measures that will be put in place to ensure that the activity is carried out in line with this Resolution, and the manner in which these rules will be made mandatory for operators. The fishing plan should be analysed, and, as appropriate, endorsed by Panel 2 intersessionally (Rec. 22-08, paragraph 11). 6. CPCs who wish to engage in the pilot project on short-term live storage of bluefin tuna should do so in accordance with this Resolution, including Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. 7. The pilot project will be assessed by the Commission within three years to determine whether and how the activity should continue beyond the pilot project stage. CPCs participating in the pilot project will submit a report on the results of the project for consideration by the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS), and the Commission no later than 2027. The report should, inter alia, clearly identify any difficulties in carrying out the pilot project, including if there are provisions of the appendices or relevant ICCAT Recommendations that cannot be implemented. 8. The CPCs who engaged in the pilot project shall report to the Commission on the implementation of this pilot by 1 October every year until the final report is due for assessment by the Commission. This report shall include information on the storage amount and the statistics on implementation and verification and control procedures and the outcomes of that process and data about these trade events, including relevant statistical information. 121 Appendix 1 Definitions 1. For purposes of the short-term lives storage pilot project: a) “auxiliary vessel” means any vessel used to transport dead bluefin tuna (not processed) from a storage cage, a purse seine vessel to a designated port, and/or to a processing vessel. b) “eBCD” means an electronic bluefin catch document. c) “caging” means the relocation of live bluefin tuna from the transport cage to the storage cage. d) “catching vessel” means a vessel used for the purposes of the commercial capture of bluefin tuna resources. e) “control camera” means a stereoscopic camera and/or conventional video camera for the purpose of the controls foreseen in this Appendix. f) “harvesting” means the killing of bluefin tuna taken from a storage cage. g) “fishing vessel” means any powered vessel used for the purposes of the commercial exploitation of bluefin tuna resources, including catching vessels, fish processing vessels, support vessels, towing vessels, vessels engaged in transshipment, and transport vessels equipped for the transportation of tuna products and auxiliary vessels, except container vessels. h) “short-term live storage” means keeping bluefin tuna in a storage cage up to a maximum of three months, without fattening them or increasing their total biomass. i) “stereoscopic camera” means a camera with two or more lenses, with a separate image sensor or film frame for each lens, enabling the taking of three -dimensional images for the purpose of measuring the length of the fish and assisting in refining the number and weight of bluefin tuna. j) “storage cage” means cages that are used for the short -term live storage of bluefin tuna. k) “transport cage” means cages that are used for the transport of live tuna to the storage cage. l) “transfer operations” means: a) any transfer of live bluefin tuna from the catching vessel's net to the transport cage; b) any transfer of live bluefin tuna from a transport cage to a storage cage; c) any transfer of live bluefin tuna from a storage cage to a transport cage. Authorization 2. Any CPC that takes part in the pilot project for the short-term live storage, will designate a competent authority, hereafter referred to as the “CPC competent authority”, that will be responsible for coordinating the collection and verification of inform ation for the control of transfers, caging, harvesting and related transports of bluefin tuna conducted under its jurisdiction. 3. Before the start of a transfer operation, caging or harvesting, the Master of the catching vessel or its representative, or the representative of the storage cage, will send a prior notification to the CPC competent authority indicating the following, as applicable, depending on the operation: - the number of individuals and the estimated weight of the bluefin tuna in kg; - the name of the catching vessel or storage cage, with their respective ICCAT record number; - the date and the location of the catch, caging or harvesting; 122 - the date and estimated time of transfer, caging or harvesting; - the eBCD number concerned, as confirmed and validated by the CPC competent authority; - details of auxiliary vessels involved in the operation; - estimated quantities to be transferred, caged or harvested in number of individuals and kg. 4. A transfer, caging or harvesting operation will not be authorized by the CPC competent authority if, on the receipt of the prior notification, it considers that: - the catching vessel does not have a valid authorization to fish for bluefin tuna; - the number and weight of fish have not been duly reported by the master of the catching vessel or its representative, or the representative of the storage cage; - the catching vessel that has caught the fish does not have sufficient quota; - the storage cage of destination is not reported as active; - the fish to be caged have not been duly reported by the catching vessel, and have not been taken into account for the calculation of any quota uptake that may be applicable; - the ICCAT regional observer is not present and no derogation is applicable; - relevant activities have not been appropriately recorded in the eBCD system. Unique numbers and catching vessels assigned to cages 5. All cages used in transfer, caging and harvesting operations and associated transports will be numbered in accordance with the unique numbering system referred to in the multi -annual conservation and management plan for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean b luefin tuna (Rec. 22-08, paragraphs 147-150). 6. To facilitate traceability, a storage cage will only contain bluefin tuna from one catching vessel. The CPC competent authority may authorize a vessel to utilize an empty cage which has previously been used by a different vessel. If the bluefin tuna has been tagged, a storage cage can contain bluefin tuna from more than one catching vessel. Control measures 7. Before the start of a transfer operation, caging or harvesting, the master of the catching vessel or its representative, or the representative of the storage cage, will report their activities in their electronic fishing logbook and forward the information to the CPC competent authority on a daily basis. 8. All transfer and caging operations will be monitored by control camera in the water, in accordance with the minimum standards and procedures set out in Appendix 2, to determine the number of individuals of bluefin tuna. All caging operations should be recorded using both conventional and stereoscopic cameras in the water, and all video footage should comply with the minimum standards set out in Appendix 2. 9. A copy of the relevant video records will be provided to the regional observer and to the CPC competent authority immediately. Copies of the video records should be provided by the CPC competent authority to the SCRS upon request. The SCRS should keep the confidentiality of commercial activities. 10. The CPC competent authority will determine the number and weight of the bluefin tuna being caged by analyzing the video footage of each caging operation. To carry out this analysis, the authorities will follow the relevant standards and procedures for stereoscopic camera systems set out in the applicable annexes, including Annex 9, of the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 21 -08 Amending Recommendation establishing a multi -annual conservation and management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (Rec. 22-08). 123 11. The CPC will ensure 100% observer coverage from the ICCAT Regional Observer Programme referred to in Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 21 -08 Amending Recommendation establishing a multi-annual conservation and management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (Rec. 22 -08 and any successor recommendations) during all catching, transfer, caging and harvesting operations. 12. Notwithstanding the above, when, for reasons of force majeure (e.g., pandemic) duly notified to ICCAT, the deployment of a regional observer is not possible, the vessel or storage cage may operate without the observer. In such cases, CPCs will prioritize s uch vessels and storage cages for control and inspection. In addition, CPCs will implement a set of appropriate alternative measures aimed at achieving the objectives of the regional observer programme, including, where possible, deploying either a nationa l inspector or a national observer to act in locum of the regional observer. The CPC concerned will send all details of the alternative measures to the Secretariat. The Secretariat will compile and circulate all the information received on the implementati on of these procedures to the Commission. Such alternative measures and the actions taken will be examined by the Compliance Committee during each annual meeting. 13. By way of derogation from paragraph 11 harvesting from each storage cage up to 1000 kg per day and up to a maximum of 50 tons per storage cage per year to supply the fresh bluefin tuna market, may be authorized by the relevant CPC provided that an authoriz ed inspector from the storage cage CPC is onsite for 100% of such harvests, and controls the entire operation. The authorized inspector will also validate the harvested quantities in the eBCD system. In this case, the regional observer’s signature is not required in the harvest section of the eBCD. 14. At arrival of the transport cage in the vicinity of the storage cage, the storage cage CPC competent authority will ensure that: a) if a regional observer is not onboard the catching vessel concerned, the vessel should maintain at a distance of minimum 1 nautical mile from any facility until the storage cage CPC competent authority is physically present; and b) the position and activity of the relevant towing vessels is monitored at all times. c) No caging operation will start: - before it has been duly authorized by the storage cage CPC competent authority; - without the presence of the storage cage CPC competent authority and the ICCAT regional observer; - before the catch and live trade sections of the eBCD have been completed and validated by the catching flag or storage cage CPC competent authority(ies). 15. After transfer of the bluefin tuna from the towing cage to the storage cage, the storage cage CPC control authority will ensure that storage cages containing bluefin tuna are sealed at all times following the sealing operations procedure contained in Annex 14 of Rec. 22 -08. Unsealing will only be possible in the presence of the storage cage CPC competent authority and following its authorization. The storage cage CPC control authority should establish protocols for the sealing of storage cages, ensuring the use of official seals and that these seals are placed in such a way that they prevent the opening of doors without the seals being broken. 16. The short-term live storage CPC competent authority will carry out random controls in storage cages under their jurisdiction (Rec. 22 -08, paragraphs 208 -215). The CPC will describe the measures for random controls in their annual fishing plan (Rec. 22-08, paragraph 12). 17. Each transfer, caging and harvesting operation will be recorded in the eBCD system to ensure appropriate traceability. 124 18. Notwithstanding the above, all vessels used to transport live bluefin tuna will, irrespective of their length, install and operate a VMS, in accordance with Rec. 18 -10, and transmit messages at least once every hour. Dead and dying fish 19. During transfer and caging operations, and during the period the bluefin tuna is stored in the storage cages, sick, injured, dead and dying fish will be removed and those not yet dead will be killed. These fish will be entered into the eBCD system and may be traded. Enforcement 20. CPCs will take appropriate enforcement measures with respect to the master of the catching vessel or its representative, or the representative of the storage cage, where it has been established, in accordance with its law, that the fishing vessel or storag e cage flying its flag does not comply with the provisions of this appendix. 21. The measures will be commensurate with the gravity of the offence and in accordance with the pertinent provisions of national law in such a way as to make sure that they effectively deprive those responsible of the economic benefit derived from their infringement without prejudice to the exercise of their profession. Those sanctions will also be capable of producing results proportionate to the seriousness of such infringement, thereby effectively discouraging further offences of the same kind. 125 Appendix 2 Minimum standards for video recording procedures applicable to transfer, caging and/or release operations 1. Each storage cage CPC concerned should ensure that the following procedures apply to all video recordings of transfer, caging and/or release operations referred to in this Resolution: a) At the beginning and/or the end of each video, where requested, the ICCAT transfer or caging authorization number or release order should be displayed; b) The time and the date of the video should be continuously displayed throughout each video record; c) The video record should be continuous without any interruptions and cuts, and cover the entire transfer, caging and/or release operation; d) Before the start of the transfer, caging and/or release operation, the video record should include the opening and closing of the net/door and, for transfers and caging operations, show whether the receiving and donor cage(s) already contain bluefin tuna; e) The video record should be of sufficient quality to determine the number and, where appropriate the weight, of bluefin tuna being transferred, caged and/or released; f) The original video record should be kept on board the donor vessel, or by the storage cage operator where appropriate, during their entire period of authorization to operate; g) The electronic storage device containing the original video record should be immediately provided to the ICCAT regional and/or CPC national observer after the end of the transfer, caging and/or release operation. The ICCAT regional observer and/or CPC observer should immediately initialize it to avoid any further manipulation. 2. Each flag and storage cage CPC concerned should establish the necessary measures to avoid any replacement, edition or manipulation of the original video records. 126 22-10 BFT RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT FOR A CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR WESTERN ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA (Entry into force 23 June 2023) NOTING that the objective of the Convention is to maintain populations of tuna and tuna -like species at levels that will support Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY); MINDFUL that, in anticipation of completing a 20 -year rebuilding program in 2018, the Commission adopted the Recommendation by ICCAT for an interim conservation and management plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Rec. 17-06); RECALLING that the SCRS, being unable to resolve recruitment uncertainty , provided short -term management advice in 2017 based on a fishing mortality rate (F 0.1) that the SCRS considered to be a reasonable proxy for FMSY and that accounted for the effect of recruitment changes on stock biomass, which provided the basis for interim stock management pending development of a Management Procedure (MP) through the Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) process; RECALLING FURTHER that Rec. 17 -06 was amended and extended through 2021 by the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 17 -06 for an interim conservation and management plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Rec. 20-06) and that it was amended and extended again through 2022 by the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 17 -06 for an interim conservation and management plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Rec. 21-07), which included a n increase in the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) after taking into consideration SCRS advice in 2021; FULLY AWARE of the intention to replace the interim conservation and management plan first adopted in 2017 with a conservation and management plan based on an MP tested through MSE in order to manage bluefin tuna fisheries more effectively in the face of identified uncertainties; APPRECIATING the substantial work undertaken by ICCAT to advance MSE for bluefin tuna, including adoption of the Resolution by ICCAT on development of initial management objectives for eastern and western bluefin tuna (Res. 18 -03), and intersessional activities aimed at finalizing these management objectives consistent with the Convention and Recommendation by ICCAT on the principles of decision making for ICCAT conservation and management measures (Rec. 11-13) and Recommendation by ICCAT on the development of Harvest Control Rules and Management Strategy Evaluation (Rec. 15-07); RECOGNIZING the completed MSE framework developed by the SCRS that has been used to test candidate MPs to demonstrate tradeoffs between management objectives identified by Panel 2 with regard to stock status, safety, stability, and yield and considering the outcome of that testing, which also included examination of 2- and 3-year management cycles and the possible establishment of a minimum TAC change threshold; WELCOMING the adoption of an MP in 2022 to establish TACs for both the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean and western Atlantic bluefin tuna management areas starting in 2023; RECOGNIZING that an important element of the MP is its review and that the SCRS has recommended that the first review be completed by 2028 to ensure the MP is performing as expected and to determine whether there are conditions that warrant reconditioning the MSE operating models; retuning the existing MP; and/or considering alternate candidate management procedures or a new, full MSE; HIGHLIGHTING the value of continued research on the stock, including increased fisheries and biological sampling, to provide additional support toward addressing some key uncertainties in the stock assessment and the MSE, including size structure of catches and release s, genetic samples for stock identification and genetic mark -recapture studies, age and growth estimation, and electronic tagging for monitoring stock migrations and rates of mixing; 127 RECOGNIZING the Resolution by ICCAT on Criteria for the Allocation of Fishing Possibilities (Res. 15-13); RENEWING the commitment to the full implementation of existing mandatory reporting obligations including those in the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Recording of Catch by Fishing Vessels in the ICCAT Convention Area (Rec. 03-13); THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities and Fishing Entities (CPCs) whose vessels have been actively fishing for bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic shall implement the following conservation and management plan starting in 2023, including establishing TACs based on the application of the bluefin tuna management procedure (MP) adopted in Recommendation by ICCAT establishing a management procedure for Atlantic bluefin tuna to be used for both the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean management areas (Rec. 22-091). Effort and capacity limits 2. In order to avoid increasing fishing mortality of bluefin tuna in the eastern or western Atlantic, CPCs shall continue to take measures to prohibit any transfer of fishing effort from the western Atlantic to the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean and from the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean to the western Atlantic. TACs, TAC allocations, and catch limits 3. In accordance with the application of the MP established in Rec. 22 -09, an annual TAC, inclusive of dead discards, of 2,726 t is established for 2023, 2024, and 2025. The TACs for the 2026-2028 period shall be established at the 2025 ICCAT Annual meeting, in accordance with the application of the MP. 4. CPCs shall update abundance indices and fishery indicators annually and provide them to the SCRS when requested in support of the annual assessment by the SCRS of the occurrence of exceptional circumstances, as specified in Rec. 22-09 and for other relevant scientific purposes as determined by the SCRS. 5. The allocation of the annual TAC, inclusive of dead discards, shall be as follows: a) The annual TAC shall include the following allocations: CPC Allocation USA (bycatch related to longline fisheries in vicinity of management area boundary) 25 t Canada (bycatch related to longline fisheries in vicinity of management area boundary) 15 t 1 This measure was repealed and replaced by Recommendation 23-07. 128 b) After subtracting the amounts under paragraph 5 a), the remainder of the annual TAC will be allocated as follows: If the remainder of the annual TAC is: CPC <2,413 t (A) 2,413 t (B) >2,413- 2,660 t (C) >2,660 t (D) United States 54.02% 1,303 t 1,303 t 49.00% Canada 22.32% 539 t 539 t 20.24% Japan 17.64% 426 t 426 t + all increase between 2,413 t and 2,660 t 24.74% United Kingdom (in respect of Bermuda) 0.23% 5.5 t 5.5 t 0.23% France (in respect of St. Pierre & Miquelon) 0.23% 5.5 t 5.5 t 0.23% Mexico 5.56% 134 t 134 t 5.56% c) Consistent with paragraphs 1, 3, and 5 b), the annual TACs for 2023-2025 result in the following CPC-specific quota allocations, not including bycatch allowances listed in 5 a): Annual TAC for 2023-2025: 2,726 t United States 1,316.14 t Canada 543.65 t Japan 664.52 t United Kingdom (in respect of Bermuda) 6.18 t France (in respect of St. Pierre & Miquelon) 6.18 t Mexico 149.34 t In no case shall the allocation to France (in respect of St. Pierre & Miquelon) and to the United Kingdom (in respect of Bermuda) be less than 4 t each in any single year unless the fishery is closed. d) Depending on availability, Mexico can transfer up to 149.34 t of its adjusted quota in each year of 2023-2025 to Canada to support cooperative research as specified in paragraph 14. e) Depending on availability, the United Kingdom (in respect of Bermuda) can transfer up to the amount of its adjusted quota in each year of 2023 -2025 to the United States to support cooperative research as specified in paragraph 14. f) Depending on availability, France (in respect of St. Pierre & Miquelon) can transfer up to the amount of its adjusted quota in each year of 2023 -2025, to Canada to support cooperative research as specified in paragraph 14. g) CPCs planning to engage in the cooperative research activities specified in paragraphs 5 d), 5 e), and 5 f) above shall: notify the Commission and the SCRS of the details of their research programs to be undertaken before they commence and present the results of the research to the SCRS. 129 6. A CPC’s total quota shall include its allocations in paragraph 5, adjusted for underharvest or overharvest consistent with the remainder of this paragraph. Each year shall be considered as an independent management period for the remainder of this paragraph. a) Any underharvest of a CPC’s total quota in a given year may be carried forward to the next year. However, in no event shall the underharvest that is carried forward exceed 10% of the CPC’s initial quota allocation under paragraph 5, with the exception of the United Kingdom (in respect of Bermuda), France (in respect of St. Pierre and Miquelon), and Mexico (i.e., those with initial allocations of 149.34 t or less), for which the underharvest that is carried forward shall in no event exceed 100% of the initial allocation under paragraph 5 (i.e., the total quota for such CPC shall not exceed twice its annual quota in any given year). b) If, in the applicable management period, and each subsequent management period, any CPC has an overharvest of its total quota, its initial quota for the next subsequent management period will be reduced by 100% of the excess of such total quota, and ICCAT may authorize other appropriate actions. c) Notwithstanding paragraph 6 b), if a CPC has an overharvest of its total quota during any two consecutive management periods, the Commission will recommend appropriate measures, which may include, but are not limited to, reduction in the CPC’s total quota equal to a minimum of 125% of the overharvest amount and, if necessary, trade restrictive measures. Any trade measures under this paragraph will be import restrictions on the subject species and consistent with each CPC’s international obligations. The tra de measures will be of such duration and under such conditions as the Commission may determine. Minimum fish size requirements and protection of small fish 7. CPCs shall prohibit the taking and landing of western Atlantic bluefin tuna weighing less than 30 kg or, in the alternative, having a fork length of less than 115 cm. 8. Notwithstanding the above measures, CPCs may grant tolerances to capture western Atlantic bluefin tuna either weighing less than 30 kg, or in the alternative, having a fork length of less than 115 cm, provided they limit the take of these fish to no more than 10% by weight of the total bluefin tuna quota for each CPC, and institute measures to deny economic gain to the fishermen from such fish. Any overharvest of such tolerance limit from one year must be subtracted from the tolerance limit applicable in the next year or the year after that. CPCs granting such a tolerance will prohibit the taking and landing of western Atlantic bluefin tuna having a fork length of less than 67 cm, except as the subject of a research project notified to the SCRS, developed ta king into consideration the recommended research priorities of the SCRS, and conducted by individuals duly permitted by the CPC to undertake such research. 9. CPCs shall prohibit fishermen from selling or offering for sale recreationally harvested fish of any size. 10. CPCs will encourage their commercial and recreational fishermen to tag and release all fish less than 30 kg or, in the alternative, having a fork length less than 115 cm and report on steps taken in this regard in their Annual Report. Area and time restrictions 11. There shall be no directed fishery on the bluefin tuna spawning stock in the western Atlantic spawning grounds (i.e., the Gulf of Mexico). In light of advice received from the SCRS pursuant to paragraph 18, the Commission shall consider revising this measure and the need for alternative management actions, taking into account the efforts of Mexico and other CPCs to conserve western Atlantic bluefin tuna, including reducing bycatch. Transshipment 12. Transshipment at-sea shall be prohibited. 130 Scientific research and data and reporting requirements 13. Canada, the United States, Japan, Mexico, and, as appropriate, other CPCs harvesting western Atlantic bluefin tuna shall continue to collaborate in the improvement of existing indices of abundance and the development of new combined indices. 14. CPCs that harvest Atlantic bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic should make every effort to contribute to priority research and other scientific activities , including that being undertaken through or in collaboration with the ICCAT GBYP. With a view to facilitating the reconditioning of the MSE operating models and supporting review of the MP by 2028, CPCs should support the SCRS in carrying out the four strategic initiatives it has identified in the SCRS report: - coordination of BFT tagging, - coordination of larval surveys, - coordination of BFT biological sampling, - advanced genomic approaches to population size estimation (CKMR/Gene tagging). 15. In carrying out the work specified in paragraph 14, as contributions to SCRS research, CPCs should make or continue special efforts to enhance Atlantic bluefin tuna fisheries sampling, including: providing information on fish lengths and/or weights by flee t, month, and area; and, the collection of biological samples, including tissue and otoliths, which are critical for genetic close -kin mark - recapture and stock of origin analyses. 16. All CPCs shall monitor and report on all sources of fishing mortality, including dead discards, and shall minimize dead discards to the extent practicable. 17. Each CPC shall ensure that its fishing vessels landing bluefin tuna are subject to a data recording system, in accordance with the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning the recording of catch by fishing vessels in the ICCAT Convention area (Rec. 03-13). 18. Further to paragraph 11, the SCRS shall review any new available information related to the identification of specific spawning times and areas of bluefin tuna within the western Atlantic Ocean, including from those CPCs that harvest western Atlantic bluefin tuna, and advise the Commission on the results of this review for its consideration. Concerned CPCs are encouraged to work through the SCRS to develop advice for managing any identified times and specific areas under a precautionary approach. In addition, the SCRS shall advis e on the efficacy of the Gulf of Mexico directed fishery restriction to reduce mortality of spawning age bluefin tuna. 19. Each CPC shall report its provisional monthly catches of bluefin tuna. This report shall be sent to the ICCAT Secretariat within 30 days of the end of the calendar month in which the catches were made. 20. The ICCAT Secretariat shall, within 10 days following the monthly deadline for receipt of the provisional catch statistics, collect the information received and circulate it to CPCs together with aggregated catch statistics. 21. All CPCs shall provide the best available data for the assessment of the stock by the SCRS, including information on the catches of the broadest range of all age classes encountered in their fisheries, consistent with minimum size restrictions. 22. SCRS should provide guidance on a range of fish size management measures for western Atlantic bluefin tuna and their impact on yield per recruit and spawner per recruit considerations. The SCRS should also comment on the effect of fish size management measures on their ability to monitor stock status. 23. This Recommendation repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT for an interim conservation and management plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Rec. 17-06) as amended by Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 17 -06 for an interim conservation and management plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Rec. 21-07). 131 22-15 BFT RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROJECT TO TEST THE USE OF STEREOSCOPIC CAMERAS DURING FIRST TRANSFER AND THE AUTOMATION OF VIDEO FOOTAGE ANALYSIS (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 23 December 2022) TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that ICCAT has adopted the R ecommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 18-02 establishing a multi-annual management plan for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna (Rec. 19-04); NOTING that at the Meeting of the ICCAT Working Group on Bluefin Tuna Control and Traceability Measures held in March 2020, the Working Group identified several aspects of the control of live bluefin tuna that would benefit from being strengthened; NOTING that monitoring and control of the live bluefin fishery is largely based on video recordings of the various transfer and caging operations of live bluefin tuna that take place underwater and that improved control of this aspect could have an important impact on the overall control of the fishery; RECALLING that new technologies have advanced greatly over the last few years and these technologies can make monitoring more effective and efficient; CONSIDERING the establishment of a Pilot Project the use of a stereoscopic camera during first transfers and the automation of video footage analysis, could allow to solve important challenges faced by the control of this fishery, improve the accuracy of estimates of fish caught and greatly reduce the workload and cost for the authorities involved in its control; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS RESOLVES THAT: Pilot Project objective 1. The general objective of the Pilot Project is to test available technology and evaluate its added value in improving the monitoring and control on the recording and analysis of videos of transfers and caging operations taking place in the bluefin tuna fishery that is intended for fattening farms. 2. In particular the Pilot Project would have a double objective: a) to test whether the available stereoscopic cameras, in combination with conventional cameras where appropriate, can be used during the first transfers from purse seine vessels or traps to towing cages; b) to test the use of available software and artificial intelligence for the automatic analysis of the video footages, to automatically determine the number of individuals and its weight. 3. The duration of the Pilot Project should be one year, with the possibility of extending it for a further year. 4. The Pilot Project would be considered as a testing phase and the information collected in it may only be used to achieve the objectives of the project, but in no case for control or enforcement purposes. Participation and Points of Contact 5. Contracting Parties with purse seiner vessels or traps operating under their flag are encouraged to participate in the Pilot Project and facilitate the implementation on selected vessels or traps under their flag. Any other Contracting Party with an interest in the fishery is also welcome to participate in the Pilot Project. 132 6. Contracting Parties participating in the Pilot Project should submit to the Executive Secretary the following information: a) National authority responsible for the purse seine vessel or trap and its monitoring and control, and; b) Designated point(s) of contact within that authority with control responsibilities for liaison on the Project, including name, telephone, fax numbers, and e-mail address. 7. A Technical Steering Group should be set up to oversee the implementation of the Pilot Project. The Technical Steering Group should be composed at least, by representative(s) of the ICCAT Secretariat and the flag Contracting Parties of the catching vessels and traps included in the Pilot Project. Any other Contracting Parties with an interest in the fishery may also participate in the Steering Group. The Steering Group should be coordinated by the Chair of the Working Group on Bluefin Tuna Control and Traceability Measures, set up by ICCAT Resolution 19-15. 8. The Technical Steering Group should monitor the Project’s progress, the fulfilment of its objectives, set out the conclusions of the project and make recommendations based on these conclusions. They should be available for consultation and online meetings. The Steering Group should regulate its own procedures. 9. Contracting Parties participating in the Pilot Project should communicate and collaborate with each other and with the selected company(ies) in order to facilitate the implementation of the Pilot Project. Implementation of the Pilot Project 10. The ICCAT Secretariat, with the assistance of the Technical Steering Group, should identify a company(ies) entrusted to make the technology available and test it in the field. Two different companies can be identified to meet each of the two objectives men tioned in point 2 above. The minimum technical standards in Appendix 1 should be included in the tender specifications when selecting the company(ies). 11. In the selection of the company(ies), consideration will be given at least to the fact that: a) the company(ies) possesses or has access to the technology to complete the assigned objective(s); b) the company's experience in the development and use of such technologies, preferably in the bluefin tuna fishery; c) the user-friendliness of the proposed hardware and software, its operability in real conditions, its accuracy or the functionalities offered in the software that can facilitate and improve the required tasks. 12. The flag CPCs of catching vessels and traps should identify the purse seine vessels and traps that could participate in the Pilot Project and ensure that they cooperate during the project. 13. For the purposes of the objective mentioned in point 2 a) the selected company should ensure that the system is tested under real conditions. For this purpose, the company must have the availability and capability to embark on some of the patrol vessels that are deployed for the control of the bluefin tuna fishing campaign. 14. In the implementation of the Pilot Project the selected company(ies) should ensure that it follows the requirements and minimum technical standards set out in Appendix 1. 133 Reporting 15. The company in charge of the implementation of the project objective mentioned in point 2 a) should draw up a report on the tests with stereoscopic cameras, including detailed results of the tests performed, possible challenges encountered and conclusions. The company in charge of the implementation of the project objective mentioned in point 2 b) should draw up a report on the video footage analysed, including comparisons of video analysis using manual and automatic methods, and conclusions. The detailed c ontent of the reports and the reporting period will be developed by the Technical Steering Group. 16. The ICCAT Secretariat should keep all Contracting Parties updated on the progress of the project and should distribute the progress reports drawn up by the contractor and analyst and the possible evaluations of the Steering Group. 17. The Technical Steering Group should draw up a final report with the conclusions on the functioning of the Pilot Project, its effectiveness and accuracy. 134 Appendix 1 Minimum technical standards for the implementation of the Pilot Project 1. List of minimum tasks and conditions for the implementation of the Pilot Project 1.1 Objective 1. Use of stereoscopic cameras during first transfers The tasks to be carried for the implementation of the objective set out in point 2 a) of the Resolution will have as their main mission to: a) test whether the available stereoscopic cameras in combination with conventional cameras where appropriate, allow the successful recording of videos of the first transfers in real conditions; b) test the accuracy in determining the number of individuals and their average size and compare it with that obtained by current means. In the implementation of the objective set out in point 2 a) of the Resolution, the following minimum conditions should be covered by the company in charge of the implementation of the Project: - be in possession of the necessary hardware and software to be able to record videos of bluefin tuna transfers and determine the number of individuals and their average size; - have the technology (stereoscopic camera) that meets the necessary operating conditions to record first transfer videos in real conditions. The tasks to be performed would include at least: - test the system on at least two transfers in each of the following scenarios: • first transfer from a purse seiner to a transport cage in the Mediterranean; • first transfer from a trap to a transport cage; • first transfer from a purse seiner to a transport cage in the Adriatic; • transfer between two farm or transport cages under controlled conditions (i.e., the number of individuals and their average size is known, the operation can be repeated, if necessary, the transfer is recorded with the three types of cameras, conventional camera, stereoscopic camera currently used at caging and, if relevant, the new stereoscopic camera being tested, ...). - compare the results of the number of individuals with those obtained from recording the transfer with a conventional camera, including assessing the time invested, the ease and accuracy of counting the number of individuals; - compare the average length results of the transferred individuals with those obtained after the analysis of the stereoscopic camera video of the caged fish (for cases where there are no additional transfers after the first transfer), including assessing th e time invested, the ease and accuracy of measure the bluefin tuna individuals. In the recording of transfer videos, the company should consider the minimum standards set out in Annex 8 of the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 21 -08 establishing a multi -annual management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 22 -08). For the determination of the average size of the transferred bluefin tuna individuals the system has to offer at least the same accuracy as the system currently used according to the specifications in Annex 9 of ICCAT Rec. 22- 08. 135 The list of tasks mentioned above is without prejudice to possible changes that may be introduced as a result of technical discussions between the Technical Steering Group and the company in charge of the implementation of the Project, and provided that th ese changes do not entail a significant increase in the time or resources to be assumed by the company. 1.2 Objective 2. Automatic analysis of the video footages, to automatically determine the number of individuals and its weight The tasks to be carried for the implementation of the objective set out in point 2 b) of the Resolution will have as their main mission to: a) provide the necessary software to make an automatic analysis (counting of the number of individuals and estimation of the average size) of the video records from conventional and/or stereoscopic cameras; b) achieve a precision in the counting of the number of individuals and estimation of the average size that is at least as high as that achieved with the current means. In relation to the implementation of the objective set out in point 2 b) of the Resolution, the following minimum conditions should be covered by the company in charge of the implementation of the Project: - be in possession of the necessary software to be able to automatically determine the number of bluefin tuna individuals and its average size for transfers and caging operations recorded with conventional and/or stereoscopic camera; - where possible, ensure that the software provided can be used in situ (i.e., at sea) and without the need for an internet connection; - ensure that the result of the automatic video analysis offers an accuracy that is at least as good as that obtained with current means. For testing the proposed software, three different data sources should be used: a) results obtained using the proposed software; b) results obtained using conventional means; c) results obtained by the authorities when they are available. The tasks to be performed would include at least: - analyze, using the proposed software for automatic counting, at least four videos of transfers in the Mediterranean recorded with a conventional camera; - analyze, using the proposed software for automatic counting, at least four videos of transfers in the Adriatic recorded with a conventional camera; - analyze (determine the number of individuals and their average size), using the proposed software for automatic counting and measurement, at least four videos of caging operations in the Mediterranean recorded with a stereoscopic camera, in combination wit h conventional cameras where appropriate; - analyze (determine the number of individuals and their average size), using the proposed software for automatic counting at least four videos of caging operation in the Adriatic recorded with a stereoscopic camera, in combination with conventional cameras where appropriate; - determine, using conventional means, the number of individuals and in the case of stereoscopic camera videos, the average size, of the transfers and caging operations analyzed in the previous cases; 136 - use results obtained by the control authorities, in the case of stereoscopic camera videos and in the case of transfers when these are available; - make comparisons of the results using the three different sources, report the detailed results and draw conclusions. The list of tasks mentioned above is without prejudice to possible changes that may be introduced as a result of technical discussions between the Technical Steering Group and the company in charge of the implementation of the project, and provided that th ese changes do not entail a significant increase in the time or resources to be assumed by the company. 137 23-07 BFT RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT AMENDING RECOMMENDATION 22-09 ESTABLISHING A MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE FOR ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA TO BE USED FOR BOTH THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND EASTERN ATLANTIC AND MEDITERRANEAN MANAGEMENT AREAS (Entry into force 18 June 2024) NOTING that the objective of the Convention is to maintain populations of tuna and tuna -like species at levels that will support Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY); RECALLING that the Commission often had difficulties in deciding the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) based on advice from the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS); ALSO RECALLING that the SCRS had difficulties in providing robust scientific advice to the Commission due to various uncertainties such as the low quality of data; RECOGNIZING that Harvest Control Rules (HCRs) and Management Procedures (MPs) developed using Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) provide a more robust management framework than that based on a conventional stock assessment, ensuring a more precautionary approach and better stability of TACs; ALSO RECOGNIZING the intent of the Commission to adopt HCRs and MPs developed using MSE, as established in Recommendation by ICCAT on the development of Harvest Control Rules and of Management Strategy Evaluation (Rec. 15-07); NOTING the Resolution by ICCAT on developing initial management objectives for eastern and western bluefin tuna (Res. 18-03), which outlined the conceptual objectives for the Atlantic bluefin tuna MSE; RECALLING that the Commission requested the SCRS to continue testing various candidate MPs in 2022 and to meet with Panel 2 to review the results and support the Panel in selecting one to adopt and apply for 2023 as anticipated in the 2021 Recommendations, the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 17-06 for an interim conservation and management plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Rec. 21 -07) and Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 19 -04 amending Recommendation 18-02 establishing a multi-annual management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 21-08) and for this purpose Panel 2 held four intersessional meetings in 2022; STRESSING the importance that all the stakeholders are involved in the MSE process since the MP automatically calculates the TAC to be adopted by the Commission unless it encountered an exceptional circumstance that is not envisaged by the MP; APPRECIATING the efforts of all the scientists involved in the MSE process who made tremendous contribution not only to the scientific work but also to better communication of the results to various stakeholders involved in the bluefin tuna fisheries, including throug h informal ambassador meetings in three languages; RECOGNIZING that the bluefin tuna MSE framework evaluated the status of the stock over the course of a 30-year projection period ending in 2052; FURTHER RECOGNIZING that the relative biomass statistic (lowest depletion or LD value, which is the spawning biomass relative to dynamic SSBMSY) will be evaluated across years 11-30 in this projection period to provide time for the MP to rebuild stocks given that the MSE operating models have been designed to cover a wide range of plausible scenarios, including scenarios that depict the stocks in a depleted state in the first 10 years of the 30-year projection period; NOTING the importance of establishing an exceptional circumstances protocol in 2023 that could result in suspending or modifying the application of the MP; 138 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Part I General provisions 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) whose vessels fish for Atlantic bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus) in the Convention area shall implement the following MP. This MP shall be used to calculate the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for both the western Atlantic management area (hereafter called “the western management area”) and the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean management area (hereafter called “the eastern management area”). Management objectives 2. The management objectives for Atlantic bluefin tuna are: a) Stock Status: − Both the western and eastern stocks should have a 60% or greater probability of occurring in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot (no overfishing occurring and not overfished); b) Safety: − There should be a 15% or less probability of either stock falling below BLIM1; c) Yield: − Maximize overall catch levels in both the western and eastern management areas; d) Stability: − Any change in TAC between consecutive management periods in both the western and eastern management areas should be no more than a 20% increase or a 35% decrease. Performance Measures (indicators) used to evaluate the performance of MPs for each management objective are found in Annex 1. Part II Management procedure and catch limits 3. Consistent with the management objectives specified in paragraph 2, the BR management procedure has been selected and is fully described in Annex 2. TAC setting 4. The first TACs derived from the MP shall apply in 2023, 2024, and 2025. The management cycle length shall be three years; therefore, the MP shall be applied every three years. 5. Notwithstanding the stability management objective in paragraph 2d, there will be a phase -in period of one management cycle where the decrease in TAC shall be no more than 10%. 6. If the TAC change as a result of the application of the MP is less than 50 t for the western management area and 1,000 t for the eastern management area, the TAC shall not be changed. 7. According to the timeline set out in Annex 3, the SCRS shall run the MP specified in Annex 2 and advise the Commission of the resulting TAC for both the western management area and the eastern management area. 1 For the purposes of this bluefin tuna MSE, the Commission has agreed to use a B LIM of 40% of the dynamic spawning stock biomass at Maximum Sustainable Yield. 139 8. The Commission shall then adopt the TACs based on the outcome of the MP, unless the SCRS identifies exceptional circumstances that require consideration of alternative management actions to be taken by the Commission. 9. The SCRS shall assess the occurrence of exceptional circumstances annually and the Commission shall act in accordance with the exceptional circumstances protocol set out in Annex 4. TAC implementation 10. The MP shall be applied according to the determined schedule and procedure and the resulting TACs for the eastern and western management areas shall be implemented and monitored according to the provisions set out in the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 21 -08 establishing a Multi-annual Management Plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (Rec. 22-08) and the Recommendation by ICCAT for a Conservation and Management Plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Rec. 22-10). Part III Final provisions 11. A review of the performance of the MP by the Commission and the SCRS shall be completed by 2028 and every 6 years thereafter. The aim of the review is to ensure the MP is performing as expected and to determine whether there are conditions that justify its continuation, or that warrant: reconditioning the MSE operating models; retuning the existing MP; including new indices into a new MP; and/or considering alternate candidate management procedures or development of a new MSE framework. Based on that review and subsequent SCRS advice, the Commission shall decide on future management measures, approaches, and strategies, including, inter alia, regarding TAC levels, for bluefin tuna stocks in both management areas. 12. This Recommendation repeals and replaces Recommendation by ICCAT establishing a management procedure for Atlantic bluefin tuna to be used for both the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean management areas (Rec. 22-09). 140 Annex 1 Table of Operational Management Objectives and Performance Measures Performance Measures are calculated based on 48 simulations/replicates for each of the 48 operating models of a 30-year projection under a CMP. Management Objectives Primary Performance Measures Secondary Performance Measures Status Both the western and eastern stocks should have a 60% or greater probability of occurring in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot (no overfishing occurring and not overfished). (To be evaluated at intermediate points between zero and 30 years, and at the end of the 30-year period.) PGK: Probability of being in the Kobe green quadrant (i.e., SSB≧dynamic SSBMSY1 and U<U MSY2) in year 30 of the management period (2052). Br30 – Br (i.e., biomass ratio, or spawning stock biomass (SSB) relative to dynamic SSBMSY) after 30 years. AvgBr – Average Br over projection years 11-30. Br20 – Br after 20 years. POF – Probability of overfishing (U>UMSY) after 30 projected years. PNRK – Probability of not being in the red Kobe quadrant (SSB ≧ SSBMSY and/or U < U MSY) after 30 projected years. OFT – Overfished Trend, SSB trend if Br30<1. Safety There should be a 15% or less probability of either stock falling below B LIM at any point during the years 11-30 of the projection period. LD* – Lowest depletion (i.e., the lowest SSB relative to dynamic SSBMSY) over years 11 -30 in the projection period. LD* value is evaluated relative to B LIM (40% of dynamic SSB MSY). LD* 15% (15th percentile) is used as the primary performance measures. LD* – LD*5% (5th percentile) and LD*10% (10th percentile) are presented in the secondary performance measures. Yield Maximize overall catch levels in both western and eastern management areas. AvC10 – Median TAC (t) over years 1-10. AvC30 – Median TAC (t) over years 1-30. C1 – TAC in first 3 years of MP (i.e., 2023-25). AvC20 – Median TAC (t) over years 1-20. Stability Any change in TAC between consecutive management periods in both the western and eastern management areas should be no more than a 20% increase or a 35% decrease, except during the first application of the MP, where any TAC change shall not exceed a 20% increase or a 10% decrease. VarC – Variation in TAC (%) between management cycles. 1 Dynamic SSBMSY is a set fraction of dynamic SSB0, which is the spawning stock biomass that would occur in the absence of fishing, historically and in the future. Dynamic SSBMSY can change over time since it is based on current recruitment levels, which fluctuate due to time-varying dynamics in the models. 2 The exploitation rate (U) is annual catch (in tonnes) divided by the total annual biomass in tonnes. U MSY is the fixed harvest rate (U) corresponding with SSB/SSBMSY=1 at year 50. 141 Annex 2 Description and formulae for calculating TACs for western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna management areas using the BR Management Procedure The BR MP is empirical, based on inputs related to abundance indices which are first standardised for magnitude, then aggregated by way of a weighted average of all indices available for the East or for the West areas as appropriate (Table A1, five indices in each management area), and finally smoothed over years to reduce observation error variability effects. TACs are then set based on the concept of taking a fixed proportion of the abundance present, as indicated by these aggregated and smoothed abundance indices. Aggregate abundance indices An aggregate abundance index is developed for each of the East and the West areas by first standardising each index available for that area to an average value of 1 over the past years for which the index appeared reasonably stable, and then taking a weigh ted average of the results for each index, where the weight is inversely proportional to the variance 1 of the residuals used to generate future values of that index in the future modified to take into account the loss of information content as a result of autocorrelation. The mathematical details are as follows: The indices, 𝐼𝑦 𝑖 , are first standardised to an average value of 1 over the past years for which the index appeared reasonably stable: 𝐼𝑦 𝑖∗= 𝐼𝑦𝑖 ∑ 𝐼𝑦𝑖𝑦2𝑖 𝑦1𝑖 (𝑦2𝑖−𝑦1𝑖+1)⁄ (A1) where 𝑦1 𝑖 and 𝑦2 𝑖 specify the period to which each index (i) is standardised (Table A1). 𝐽𝑦 𝐸/𝑊 is an average index over n series (n=5 for the East area and n=5 for the West area): 𝐽𝑦 𝐸/𝑊= ∑ 𝑤𝑖×𝐼𝑦𝑖∗𝑛 𝑖 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑛 𝑖 (A2) where 𝑤𝑖= 1 √𝜎𝑖 (i.e., effective inverse variance to the power ¼ weighting). 𝜎𝑖 is computed as 𝜎𝑖= 𝑆𝐷𝑖 1−𝐴𝐶𝑖 , where SDi is the standard deviation of the residuals in log space and AC i is their autocorrelation, averaged over the OMs, as used for generating future pseudo-data. Table A1 lists these values for 𝑤𝑖. For the West, the weights computed above for US_RR_66_144, JPN_LL_West2 and CAN_SWNS have been multiplied by 3 (i.e., 𝑤𝑖→3𝑤𝑖). This change has been implemented to avoid a steep drop in the median TAC for the West area during the 2030s. In case of a missing index value in year y, 𝐽𝑦 𝐸/𝑊, is computed by setting wi to zero, i.e., that index is disregarded when averaging over indices for that year only. The actual index used in the MP, 𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝐸/𝑊 , is the average over the last three years for which data would be available at the time the MP would be applied, hence: 𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝐸/𝑊 = 1 3(𝐽𝑦−2 𝐸/𝑊+𝐽𝑦−3 𝐸/𝑊+𝐽𝑦−4 𝐸/𝑊) (A3) where the 𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝐸/𝑊 applies either to the East or to the West area. 1 This is modified somewhat in a few cases to provide the smoother TAC trend over time, as explained further below. 142 MP specifications The BR Fixed Proportion MP sets the TAC (in mt) every management cycle simply as a multiple of the Jav value for the area at the time (Figure A1), but subject to the change in the TAC for each area being restricted to a maximum of 20% up and 35% down (10% down for the phase-in period). For the East area: 𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸,𝑦= { ( 35032.31 𝐽2017 𝐸 )∙𝛼𝑦∙𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝐸 for 𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝐸 ≥𝑇𝐸 ( 35032.31 𝐽2017 𝐸 )∙𝛼𝑦∙ (𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝐸 ) 2 𝑇𝐸 for 𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝐸 <𝑇𝐸 (A4a) 𝛼𝑦={𝛼0+∆𝛼(𝑦−2023) for 2023≤𝑦≤2027 𝛼0+4∆𝛼 for 𝑦>2027 For the West area: 𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑊,𝑦= { ( 2269.362 𝐽2017 𝑊 )∙𝛽𝑦∙𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝑊 for 𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝑊 ≥𝑇𝑊 ( 2269.362 𝐽2017 𝑊 )∙𝛽𝑦∙ (𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝑊 ) 2 𝑇𝑊 for 𝐽𝑎𝑣,𝑦−2 𝑊 <𝑇𝑊 (A4b) 𝛽𝑦={𝛽0+∆𝛽(𝑦−2023) for 2023≤𝑦≤2030 𝛽0+7∆𝛽 for 𝑦>2030 The values 35,032.314 𝑚𝑡 and 2,269.362 𝑚𝑡 used in equations A4a and b respectively are the ICCAT Task 1 catch by management area in 2020 as at April 2022. Note that in equation (A4a), setting 𝛼𝑦=1 would amount to keeping the East area TAC the same as the corresponding catch in 2020 (as explained above) if the abundance indices stayed at their 2017 level. If 𝛼𝑦 or 𝛽𝑦>1 harvesting would be more intensive than at that time, and for 𝛼𝑦 or 𝛽𝑦<1 it would be less intensive. Below T, the law is parabolic rather than linear at low abundance (i.e., below some threshold, so as to reduce the proportion taken by the fishery as abundance drops); this is to better enable resource recovery in the event of unintended depletion of the stock. F or the BR MP, the choices of 𝑇𝐸=1 and 𝑇𝑊=1 have been made. Constraints on the extent of TAC increase and decrease ∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊= 𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑦 𝐸/𝑊 𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑦−1 𝐸/𝑊 (A5) with 𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑦 𝐸/𝑊 from equation A4. ∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊 is then modified as follows: ∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊′=exp (ln(∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊)𝑉𝑎𝑟𝐶𝑎𝑑𝑗) (A6) with a control parameter, VarCadj, taken for the BR MP to be 0.5. This parameter is introduced to reduce the magnitude of the TAC changes; the smaller the value of this parameter the smaller the TAC change. ∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊′ is then constrained to a maximum of 20% up and 35% down and 10% down for the phase -in period, if ∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊′>(1+𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑈𝑝𝐸/𝑊) then ∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊′=(1+𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑈𝑝𝐸/𝑊), or if ∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊′<(1−𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐷𝑜𝑤𝑛𝐸/𝑊) then ∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊′=(1−𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐷𝑜𝑤𝑛𝐸/𝑊) 143 The TAC is then computed as: 𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑦 𝐸/𝑊′=𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑦−1 𝐸/𝑊∙∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊′ (A7) Minimum TAC change constraints lead to the addition of the following rules: if |𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑦−1 𝐸/𝑊−𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑦 𝐸/𝑊′|<𝑚𝑖𝑛∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊 (A8) then 𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊′′=𝑇𝐴𝐶𝑦−1 𝐸/𝑊 where values for 𝑚𝑖𝑛∆𝑇𝐴𝐶𝐸/𝑊 are 50 t for the West and 1,000 t for the East.

Principles of ECs The following three general principles should be considered as a signal indicating the possibility that ECs exist: a. When there is evidence that the stock and/or fishery dynamics are in states (as defined in Table 1 a) not previously considered to be plausible in the context of the management strategy evaluation (MSE); b. When there is evidence that the data required to apply the management procedure (MP) are not available or sufficient, or are no longer appropriate (as defined in Table 1 b); and/or, c. When there is evidence that total catch for either the West area or the East area is above the total allowable catch (TAC) for the respective area set using the MP (as defined in Table 1 c). 2. Indicators for ECs and process to determine if ECs occur In light of the principles specified in Section 1, the SCRS should use Table 1 below to evaluate annually whether ECs exist and will inform the Commission of any such occurrence . Triggering an EC does not immediately result in TAC advice from the MP being rescinded; rather, it means that the SCRS needs to examine the indicators in Table 1 and determine if a change in advice is warranted. 146 Table 1. Indicators for bluefin tuna ECs and timetable for conducting the evaluation. Principle Indicator Criterion Frequency a. Stock and fishery dynamics Indices If either of the combined index values fall outside the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile range 1 in any year from the operating models used in the MSE when the accepted MP was tested. Annually Abundance, life history and fishery dynamics If there is evidence that the stock and/or fishery dynamics 2* are in states not previously considered to be plausible in the context of the MSE; such evidence would need to be so consequential that it would meaningfully affect TAC advice from the MP. After completion, presentation, and acceptance by the SCRS of a study as the new reference b. Data availability for the MP Indices If three or more indices among the 10 are missing in a single year or if two or more indices are missing consecutively for two or more years. Annually c. Implementation of the TAC Catch If the total catch for either the West area or the East area is 20% or more above the TAC for the respective area set using the MP3. Annually 1 This range is the two-tailed 95% confidence interval, which is a standard for determining statistically significant deviations. 2 Fishery dynamics: Established spatial and temporal patterns that influence catchability, selectivity, targeting, and bycatch of Atlantic bluefin tuna. 3 This discussion focuses on excess catches which would constitute EC. Exceeding TAC set though an MP by catch levels that do n ot constitute EC still carries the same potential adverse consequences of exceeding TAC determined by other means. Sufficient mechanisms to prevent exceeding the TAC should be maintained. 147 3. Actions to be taken in light of ECs If the SCRS determines that an EC exists that precludes the application of the MP or makes the application of the MP or the implementation of its results unadvisable based on the principles outlined in Section 1, the SCRS shall evaluate the nature of the EC and advise the Commission on: (a) alternative management options for the coming fishing year aimed at ensuring, at a minimum, stability in the status of the stocks, including the implications of: (i) maintaining the TACs decided through the MP, (ii) reducing the TACs by various percentages in light of indications of stock decline, and (iii) any other appropriate conservation and management actions, potentially including various percentage increases in TACs; (b) whether the existing MP can and should be adjusted or whether development of a new MP is required; and (c) whether a stock assessment or other SCRS -approved method of determining TACs is needed for providing management advice in the interim. Based on the SCRS advice on (a) above, the Commission shall decide on alternative management action(s), including, as appropriate, a reduction in TAC(s) for the following year. If the SCRS has advised that there are indications of a decline in one or both stocks that warrant an alternative management action, but the Commission is unable to agree on such an action, the TACs of the West area and/or the East area shall be reduced by 10% for the implicated areas(s) for the following year. In addition, as needed and appropriate, the SCRS shall conduct a new stock assessment and/or provide advice on new candidate MPs as soon as possible. See the flowchart below for a schematic representation of the above process: 148 The SCRS shall check if ECs exist using the indicators and criteria specified in Table 1 and according to the indicated frequency. Year 1 & 2: 1. Update indices of abundance 2. Update catch 3. Consider evidence that the stocks and fishery dynamics are in states not previously considered to be plausible in the context of the MSE 4. Consider availability of indices Year 3: 1. Check that all datasets required in running the MP are available 2. Re-run MP 3. Same checks done in Years 1 & 2 - If no ECs exist If ECs exist The TACs calculated by the MP continues to be valid (in years 1-3) and the MP continues to be applied in year 3 to calculate the TACs for the next three-year management period. SCRS determines that ECs do not preclude the application of the MP and implementation of its results (i.e., TACs). SCRS determines that EC precludes the application of the M P or makes the application of the MP or the implementation of its results (i.e., TACs) unadvisable. The SCRS shall advise the Commission on: (A) A lternative management options for the coming fishing year aimed at ensuring, at a minimum, stability in the status of the stock, including the implications of: (i) maintaining the TACs decided through the MP; (ii) reducing the TACs by various percentages, in light of indications of stock decline; and (iii) any other appropriate conservation and management actions, potentially including various percentage increases in TACs; (B) whether the existing MP can and should be adjusted or whether development of a new MP is required; and (C) whether a stock assessment or other SCRS -approved methods of determining TACs is needed for providing management advice in the interim. Based on the SCRS advice on (a) above, the Commission shall decide on alternative management action(s), including, as appropriate, a reduction in TAC(s) for the following year. If the SCRS has advised that there are indications of a decline in one or both stocks that warrant an alternative management action, but the Commission is unable to agree on such an action, the TACs of the West area and/or the East area shall be reduced by 10% for the implicated areas(s) for the following year. In addition, as needed and appropriate, the SCRS shall conduct a new stock assessment and/or provide advice on new candidate MPs as soon as possible. 149 24-05 BFT RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT AMENDING THE RECOMMENDATION 22-08 EST ABLISHING A MUL TI-ANNUAL MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR BLUEFIN TUNA IN THE EASTERN ATLANTIC AND THE MEDITERRANEAN (Entry into force 16 June 2025) ACKNOWLEDGING the advice from the SCRS to consider moving from the current recovery plan to a management plan and that the current status of the stock no longer appears to require the emergency measures introduced under the Recovery Plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 14 -04 on bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (Rec. 17-07)); CONSIDERING that the SCRS has completed a management strategy evaluation (MSE) to establish a management procedure (MP), which includes harvest control rules (HCR), and the Commission has decided on the MP at its 2022 Annual Meeting to establish Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for 2023 and thereafter; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING the impacts of the Recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean on the small -scale fleets, in particular with regards to the reduction of fishing capacity; CONSIDERING the capability of the stock to respond to several consecutive years of low recruitment, it will be paramount to ensure that fishing capacity remains within sustainable limits and that the control of capacity remains effective; TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION the importance of maintaining the scope and integrity of the control measures, and reinforcing traceability of the catches, in particular with regards to the transport of live fish and farming activities; CONSIDERING that various provisions in Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 21- 08 establishing a multi -annual management plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 22-08) were identified that would benefit from being clarified or otherwise improved and reinforced; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Part I: General Provisions and Objectives 1.

The total allowable catches (TACs), inclusive of dead discards, for 2023 to 2025 shall be set at 40,570 t, in accordance with the MP. The TACs for 2026 and thereafter shall be decided at the 2025 Commission Annual Meeting in accordance with the MP. 40,570 t shall be allocated in 2023 to 2025 in accordance with the following scheme: CPC Annual Quota in 2023-2025 (t) Albania 264 Algeria 2,023 China 112 Egypt 513 European Union 21,503 Iceland 224 Japan 3,114 Korea 221 Libya 2,548 Morocco 3,700 Namibia 50 Norway 368 Syria 129 Tunisia 3,000 Türkiye 2,600 United Kingdom 63 Chinese Taipei 101 Subtotal 40,533 Unallocated Reserves 37 TOTAL 40,570 This table shall not be interpreted to have changed the allocation keys sh own in Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 13 -07 by ICCAT to establish a multi -annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (Rec. 14-04). The new keys shall be established in the future for consideration by the Commission. Mauritania may catch up to 5 t for research in each year, if they respect the rules of reporting of catches defined in this Recommendation. The catch shall be deducted from the unallocated reserve. Senegal may catch up to 5 t for research in each year, if they respect the rules of reporting of catches defined in this Recommendation. The catch shall be deducted from the unallocated reserve. 153 Depending on availability, Chinese Taipei may transfer up to 50 t of its quota to Korea in 2023 to 2025. Recognizing the special circumstances of Iceland, Iceland may transfer up to 200 t of its quota to the European Union. 5. The flag CPC may require a catching vessel to proceed immediately to a port designated by it when the individual quota of the vessel is deemed to be exhausted. 6. Automatic carry -over of any unused quota is not authorized. A CPC may request to transfer a maximum of 5% of its annual quota from one year to the following year. The CPC shall include this request in its annual fishing/capacity plans for endorsement by the Commission. 7. No chartering operation for the bluefin tuna fishery is permitted. 8. Notwithstanding the provision of Recommendation – Temporary adjust of quotas (Rec. 01 -12), all CPCs specifically referred to in the table in paragraph 4, may transfer a portion of their quota to another CPC subject to both CPCs agreeing and providing prior notification to the ICCAT Secretariat in terms of the quantity to be transfer red. The Secretariat shall disseminate this notification to all CPCs. 9. If the catch of a CPC in any given year exceeds its allocation, the CPC shall payback in the next subsequent management period in accordance with the provisions in paragraphs 2 and 3 of ICCAT Recommendation by ICCAT regarding compliance in the bluefin tuna and North Atlantic swordfish fisheries (Rec. 96-14). Submission of annual fishing plans, fishing and farming capacity management and inspection plans and farming management plans 10. By 15 February each year, each CPC with an allocated eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna quota as well as each CPC seeking to export aquacultured bluefin tuna as referred to in Recommendation by ICCAT on aquaculture bluefin tuna (Rec. 24-07) shall submit to the ICCAT Secretariat: a) An annual fishing plan for the catching vessels and traps fishing bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean drawn up in accordance with paragraphs 12-13. b) An annual fishing capacity management plan ensuring that the CPC authorized fishing capacity is commensurate with the allocated quota drawn up to include the information set forth in paragraphs 14-21. c) Monitoring, control and inspection plan with a view to ensuring compliance with the provisions of this Recommendation. This plan shall also designate the CPC control competent authority and the list of contact points nominated as responsible for the implem entation of this monitoring, control and inspection plan. d) An annual farming management plan as appropriate, that is in line with the requirements set out in paragraphs 22 and 23, including the authorized maximum input per farm and the maximum capacity per farm and the total amount of fish by farm carried over from the previous year, in accordance with paragraphs 203-209. e) An annual aquaculture plan, as appropriate, to be made in accordance with Rec. 24-07. 11. Prior to 31 March each year and in line with paragraph 237 of this Recommendation, unless otherwise decided by the Commission, the Commission shall convene an intersessional meeting of Panel 2 to analyze and, as appropriate, endorse the plans referred to under paragraph 10. This obligation may be done by electronic means if the Commission so decides. If the Commission finds a serious fault in the plans submitted and cannot endorse these plans, the Commission shall decide on the suspension of bluefin tuna fishing in that year or export of aquacultured bluefin tuna by that CPC. Non-submission of the plan referred to above shall automatically lead to suspension of bluefin tuna fishing in that year. 154 Annual fishing plans 12. The annual fishing plan shall identify, inter alia , the quotas allocated to each gear group, when applicable, the method used to allocate and manage quotas as well as the measures to ensure the respect of the individual quotas, the open fishing seasons for each gear category and the rules on by - catch. 13. Any subsequent modification to the annual fishing plan shall be transmitted to the ICCAT Secretariat at least one working day before the exercise of the activity corresponding to that modification. Notwithstanding this provision, quota transfers between different gear groups and transfers between by-catch quota and directed quotas from the same CPC shall be allowed, provided that information on the transfers is transmitted to the ICCAT Secretariat at the latest when the transfer enters into force. Capacity management measures Fishing capacity Adjustment of fishing capacity 14. Each CPC shall adjust its fishing capacity to ensure that it is commensurate with its allocated quota by using relevant yearly catch rates by fleet segment and gear proposed by the SCRS and adopted by the Commission in 2009. Those parameters should be reviewed and each time that a stock assessment for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna is performed, including specific rates for gear type and fishing area. 15. The annual fishing capacity management plan as referred to in paragraph 10 b) shall adjust the number of catching vessels to demonstrate that the fishing capacity is commensurate with the fishing opportunities allocated to the catching vessels for the same quota period. Regarding small -scale coastal vessels, the minimum quota requirement of 5 t (catch rate defined by the SCRS in 2009) shall no longer be applicable and sectorial quotas may alternatively be applied to those vessels as follows: a) If a CPC has small -scale coastal vessels authorized to fish for bluefin tuna, it shall allocate a specific sectorial quota for those vessels and indicate in its fishing, and monitoring, control and inspection plans which additional measures it will put in place to closely monitor the quota consumption of this fleet segment. b) For the vessels from the archipelagos of Azores, Canary Islands and Madeira, a sectorial quota may be established for baitboats. Such sectorial quota and the additional conditions to monitor it shall be clearly defined in the fishing plan submitted pursuant to paragraph 10 above. 16. The adjustment of fishing capacity for purse-seine vessels shall be limited to a maximum variation of 20% compared to the baseline fishing capacity of 2018. When calculating the number of vessels using 20%, CPCs can eventually round up the figure to the next whole number. 17. By derogation to paragraph 16, CPCs may increase the number of their purse seine vessels, provided that this increase results from a conversion from other bluefin tuna fleets, that the fishing capacity remains commensurate with available fishing opportuni ties, and that, overall, the final CPC fishing capacity, between purse seiners and the fleet from which the conversion is made, does not represent a capacity increase with respect to the precedent year (2018). 18. The ratio for converting fleets as per the derogation set out in paragraph 17, should be based on the 2009 catch rates provided by the SCRS. CPCs wishing to use this derogation must include the relevant details in their annual fishing capacity plans submitted pursuant to paragraph 10. 19. CPCs may authorize the number of their traps engaged in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery which allows the full exploitation of their fishing opportunities. 20. The requirements for adjustments and for the number of traps defined in paragraphs 15, 16 and 19 shall not apply: 155 a) if developing CPCs can demonstrate that they need to develop their fishing capacity so as to fully use their quota, by using relevant yearly catch rates by fleet segment and gear proposed by the SCRS, and if such adjustments are included in their annual fi shing plan in accordance to paragraph 10; b) in the Northeast Atlantic, to those CPCs that are fishing mainly in their own economic zones (the Norwegian Economic Zone and the Icelandic Economic Zone). 21. Any calculation to establish adjustments of fishing capacity shall be made in accordance with the methodology approved at the 2009 Annual Meeting and with the conditions set in paragraphs 15 and 19, except when the CPCs concerned fish mainly in the Exclusive Economic Zones of Norway or Iceland. Farming capacity 22. Each farm CPC shall establish an annual farming management plan. Such plan shall demonstrate that the total input capacity and the total farming capacity is commensurate with the estimated amount of bluefin tuna available for farming including the informat ion referred to in paragraph 23. Revised farming management plans, if appropriate, shall be submitted to the Secretariat by 1 June each year. The Commission shall ensure that the total farming and input capacity in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean is commensurate with the total amount of bluefin tuna available for farming in the area. 23. Each CPC shall establish an annual maximum input of wild caught bluefin tuna into its farms at the level of the input quantities registered with ICCAT by its farms in 2005, 2006, 2007 or 2008. If a CPC needs to increase the maximum input of wild caught tun a in one or several of its tuna farms, that increase shall be commensurate with the fishing opportunities allocated to that CPC, including live bluefin tuna imports. 24. The ICCAT Secretariat shall compile statistics on the annual amount of caging (input of wild caught fish), harvesting, and export, by farm CPC, using the data in the eBCD system. The Standing Catch Document Scheme Working Group (CDS WG) shall consider the development of such a data extraction functionality, and until such functionality becomes available each farm CPC shall report these statistics to the ICCAT Secretariat. These statistics shall be made available on the ICCAT website subject to confidentiality requirements. Growth rates 25. Based on new available scientific information, including where relevant the result of the trials on Artificial Intelligence (AI) referred to in paragraph 167, the SCRS should consider reviewing and updating the growth table published in 2022, as soon as po ssible and present those results to the Commission. 26. Farm CPCs shall endeavor to ensure that the growth rates derived from the eBCDs are coherent with the growth rates published by the SCRS in 2022. If significant discrepancies are found between the 2022 SCRS tables and growth rates observed, that information should be sent to the SCRS for analysis. Import CPCs and farm CPCs shall be encouraged to cooperate in monitoring the growth rates in a comprehensive manner through exchange of relevant data, without prejudice to applicable rules on the protection of personal data, and to report the result of the monitoring to Panel 2, as appropriate. 27. A functionality within the eBCD system to automatically monitor growth rates shall be considered by the CDS WG in 2025. The CDS WG deliberation, among other considerations, should take into account the development and maintenance costs of the proposed functionality. 156 Part III: Technical measures Open seasons 28. Purse seine fishing for bluefin tuna shall be permitted in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean during the period from 26 May to 1 July. By way of derogation, the season in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (FAO fishing areas 37.3.1 Aegean; 37.3.2 Levant), may be open 15 May if a CPC requests it in its fishing plan. By way of derogation, the season in the Adriatic Sea (FAO fishing area 37.2.1) may be open from 26 May until 15 July, for fish farmed in the Adriatic Sea. By way of derogation the purse seine fishing season in the Norwegian Economic Zone and in the Icelandic Economic Zone shall be from 25 June to 15 November. By way of derogation, the purse seine fishing season in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean fishing zones limited to the waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco may be open from 1 May to 15 June if a CPC requests it in its fishing plan. 29. If weather conditions prevent fishing operations, CPCs may decide that the fishing seasons referred to under paragraph 28 be expanded by an equivalent number of lost days up to 10 days. 30. The catching of bluefin tuna shall be permitted in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean by large-scale pelagic longlines catching vessels over 24 m during the period from 1 January to 31 May with the exception of the area delimited by West of l0°W an d North of 42°N, as well as in the Norwegian Economic Zone, where such fishing shall be permitted from 1 August to 31 January. 31. CPCs shall establish open fishing seasons for their fleets other than purse seine vessels and vessels referred to in paragraph 30 and shall provide this information in their fishing plan defined in paragraph 12 to be analysed and as appropriate, endorsed by Panel 2 intersessionally. 32. Not later than 2022, the Commission shall decide to what extent the fishing seasons for different gear types and/or fishing areas might be extended and/or modified based on the SCRS advice without negatively influencing the stock development and by ensuring the stock is managed sustainably. Minimum size 33. The minimum size for bluefin tuna caught in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean shall be 30 kg or 115 cm fork length. Therefore, CPCs shall take the necessary measures to prohibit catching, retaining on board, transhipping, transferring, landing, tr ansporting, storing, selling, displaying or offering for sale bluefin tuna weighing less than 30 kg or with fork length of less than 115 cm. 34. By derogation from paragraph 33, a minimum size for bluefin tuna of 8 kg or 75 cm fork length shall apply to the following situations (see Annex 1): a) Bluefin tuna caught in the eastern Atlantic by baitboats and trolling boats; b) Bluefin tuna caught in the Mediterranean by the small -scale coastal fleet fishery for fresh fish by baitboats, longliners and handliners; c) Bluefin tuna caught in the Adriatic Sea for farming purposes. Notwithstanding the above, for bluefin tuna caught in the Adriatic Sea by Croatian flag vessels for the purpose of farming, the relevant CPC may grant tolerances to capture bluefin tuna having a minimum weight of 6.4 kg or, in the alternative, having a minimum fork length of 66 cm, provided they limit the take of these fish to a maximum of 7% by weight of the total quantities of bluefin tuna caught by those Croatian vessels. In addition, for bluefin tuna caught by French baitboat vessels with an overall length of less than 17 m operating in the Bay of Biscay, CPCs may grant tolerances to capture up to a maximum of 100 t of bluefin tuna having a minimum weight of 6.4 kg or, in the alternative, having a minimum fork length of 70 cm. 157 35. CPCs concerned shall issue specific authorizations to vessels fishing under the derogations referred to in paragraph 34 . In addition, fish below these minimum sizes that are discarded dead shall be counted against the CPC quota. Incidental catches of fish below minimum size 36. For catching vessels fishing actively for bluefin tuna and tuna traps, CPCs may authorize an incidental catch of no more than 5% by number of bluefin tuna weighing between 8 kg and 30 kg or, in the alternative, with fork length between 75 and 115 cm. This percentage shall be calculated in relation to the total catches in number of bluefin tuna retained on board a vessel at any time after each fishing operation in the above -mentioned weight or length categories. General rules on by-catches 37. All CPCs shall allocate a specific quota for bycatch of bluefin tuna. The levels of authorized bycatches as well as the methodology to calculate those bycatches in relation with the total catches on board (in weight or number of specimens) shall be clearly defined in the annual fishing plans submitted to the ICCAT Secretariat under paragraph 10 of this Recommendation and shall never exceed 20% of the total catches on board at the end of each fishing trip. Calculation in number of pieces shall only apply to tuna and tuna -like species managed by ICCAT. For the small -scale coastal vessel fleet the amount of bycatch can be calculated on an annual basis. All bycatches of dead bluefin tuna, whether retained or discarded, shall be deducted from the quota of the flag CPC and reported to ICCAT. If bycatch of bluefin tuna occurs in waters under the fishery jurisdiction of CPCs whose current domestic legislation requires that all dead or dying fish must be landed, this landing obligation shall be complied with also by vessels flying foreign flags. If no quota has been allocated to the CPC of the catching vessel or trap concerned or if it has already been consumed, the catching of bluefin tuna as bycatch is not permitted and CPCs shall take the necessary measures to ensure their release. If, however, such bluefin tuna is dead it shall be landed, and the appropriate follow -up action taken in accordance with the national law. CPCs shall report information on such quantities on an annual basis to the ICCAT Secretariat who shall make it available to the SCRS. The procedures referred to in paragraphs 89 to 94 and 231 shall apply to by-catch. For vessels not actively fishing for bluefin tuna, any quantity of bluefin tuna kept on board shall be clearly separated from other fish species to allow control authorities to monitor the respect of this rule. The procedures for non -authorized vessels wit h regard to the eBCD shall follow as laid down in the relevant provision of Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 22 -16 amending Recommendation 21-18 on the application of the eBCD System (Rec. 24-16). Recreational fisheries and sport fisheries 38. When CPCs allocate, where appropriate, a specific quota to sport and recreational fisheries; that allocated quota should be set even if catch and release is compulsory for bluefin tuna caught in sport and recreational fisheries to account for possible dead fish. Each CPC shall regulate recreational and sport fisheries by issuing fishing authorizations to vessels for the purpose of sport and recreational fishing. 39. CPCs shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the catch and retention on board, transhipment or landing of more than one bluefin tuna per vessel per day for recreational fisheries. This prohibition does not apply to CPCs whose domestic legislation requires that all dead fish, including those caught by sport and recreational, shall be landed. 158 40. The marketing of bluefin tuna caught in recreational and sport fishing shall be prohibited. 41. Each CPC shall take measures to record catch data including weight of each bluefin tuna caught during sport and recreational fishing and communicate to the ICCAT Secretariat the data for the preceding year by 31 July each year. 42. Dead catches from sport and recreational fisheries shall be counted against the quota allocated to the CPC in accordance with paragraph 4. 43. Each CPC shall take the necessary measures to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, the release of bluefin tuna, especially juveniles, caught alive, in the framework of recreational and sport fishing. Any bluefin tuna landed shall be whole, gilled and/or gutted. 44. Any CPC wishing to conduct a sport catch -and-release fishery in the Northeast Atlantic may allow a limited number of sport vessels to target bluefin tuna with the purpose of “tag and release” without the need to allocate them a specific quota. This applies to those vessels operating in the context of a scientific project of a research institute integrated in a scientific research program results of which shall be communicated to the SCRS. In this context the CPC shall have the obligation to: (a) submit the description and associated measures applicable to this fishery as integral part of their fishing and control plans as referred under paragraph 10 of this Recommendation; (b) closely monitor the activities of the vessels concerned to ensure their compliance with the existing provisions of this Recommendation; (c) ensure that the tagging and releasing operations are performed by trained personnel to ensure high survival of the specimens; and (d) annually submit a report on the scientific activities conducted, at least 60 days before the SCRS meeting of the following year. Any bluefin tuna that die during tag and release activities shall be reported and deducted from the CPC’s quota. 45. CPCs shall make available upon request from ICCAT the list of sport and recreational vessels which have received an authorization. 46. The format for such list referred to in paragraph 45 shall include the following information: a) Name of vessel, register number; b) ICCAT Record number (if any); c) Previous name (if any); d) Name and address of owner(s) and operator(s). Use of aerial means 47. The use of any aerial means, including aircraft, helicopters or any types of unmanned aerial vehicles to search for bluefin tuna shall be prohibited. Part IV: Control measures Section A – Records of vessels, traps and farms ICCAT Record of fishing vessels 48. CPCs shall establish and maintain an ICCAT record of all fishing vessels as defined in paragraph 2 a). That record shall consist of the following lists: 159 a) catching vessels fishing actively for bluefin tuna, as per paragraph 2 g) of this Recommendation; and b) other vessels engaged in bluefin tuna related activities, other than catching vessels. 49. Each list shall include the following information: a) name and registry number of the vessel; b) specification of the type of vessel differentiating at least between: catching vessels, towing vessels, auxiliary vessels, support vessels, processing vessels; c) length and gross registered tonnage (GRT) or, where possible, gross tonnage (GT); d) IMO number (if any); e) gear used (if any); f) previous flag (if any); g) previous name (if any); h) previous details of deletion for other registers (if any); i) international radio call sign (if any); j) name and address of owner(s) and operator(s); and k) time period authorized for fishing, operating and/or transporting bluefin tuna for farming. 50. For vessels over 24 metres (independently of the gear used, excluding for bottom trawlers,) and for all purse seine vessels, CPCs shall indicate the number of vessels to the ICCAT Secretariat as part of their fishing plan defined in paragraph 10 of this Recommendation. 51. The ICCAT Executive Secretary shall establish and maintain the ICCAT Record of all catching vessels fishing actively for bluefin tuna and all other vessels authorized to operate for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean and take any me asure to ensure availability of the record through electronic means, including by placing it on the ICCAT website in a manner consistent with confidentiality requirements noted by CPCs. 52. Each flag CPC shall submit electronically each year to the ICCAT Secretariat: (i) at the latest 15 days before the beginning of the fishing activity the list of its catching vessels referred to in paragraph 48 a); and (ii) at the latest 15 days before the start of their operation the list of other fishing vessels referred to in paragraph 48 b). Submissions shall be undertaken in accordance with the format set out in the Guidelines for submitting data and information required by ICCAT. 53. No retroactive submissions shall be accepted. Subsequent changes shall only be accepted if the notified fishing vessel is prevented from participation due to legitimate operational reasons or force majeure. In such circumstances, the CPC concerned shall immediately inform the ICCAT Secretariat, providing: a) full details of the fishing vessel(s) intended to replace a vessel or vessels, included on the record referred to in paragraph 48; CPCs with less than 5 vessels on either list referred to in paragraph 48, may replace a vessel with another vessel not previously included on the record, provided that the CPC concerned submitted to the ICCAT Secretariat a request for an ICCAT number to be given to the vessel, and the requested number has been provided; 160 b) a comprehensive account of the reasons justifying the replacement and any relevant supporting evidence or references. The ICCAT Secretariat will circulate such cases among CPCs. If any CPC notifies that the case is not sufficiently justified or incomplete, it shall be brought to the Compliance Committee for further review and the case shall remain pending approval of the Compliance Committee. 54. Without prejudice to paragraph 37 for the purposes of this Recommendation, fishing vessels not entered into one of the ICCAT records referred to in paragraph 48 a) and b) are deemed not to be authorized to fish for, retain on board, tranship, transport, transfer, process or land eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna. The prohibition against retention on board does not apply to CPCs whose domestic legislation requires that all dead fish must be landed, providing that the value of the catch is subject to confiscation. 55. Conditions and procedures referred in the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 13-13 concerning the establishment of an ICCAT Record of vessels 20 metres in length overall or greater authorized to operate in the Convention area (Rec. 21-14) (except paragraph 3) shall apply mutatis mutandis. Fishing authorizations for vessels and traps authorized to fish for bluefin tuna 56. CPCs shall issue special authorizations and/or national fishing licenses to vessels and traps included in one of the lists described in paragraphs 45 , 48 and 58. Fishing authorizations shall contain as a minimum the information set out in Annex 13 . The Flag CPC shall ensure that the information contained in the fishing authorization is accurate and consistent with the rules of ICCAT. The Flag CPC shall take the necessary enforcement measures in accordance with their legislation and may require the vessel to proceed immediately to a designated port when the individual quota is deemed to be exhausted. ICCAT record of tuna traps authorized to fish for bluefin tuna 57. The Commission shall establish and maintain an ICCAT Record of all tuna traps authorized to fish for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. For the purposes of this Recommendation, tuna traps not entered into the record are deemed not to be authorized to be used to fish for, retain, and participate in any operation to catch, transfer, harvest or land bluefin tuna. 58. Each CPC shall submit electronically to the ICCAT Secretariat, as part of their fishing plan defined in paragraphs 12 to 13, the list (including the name of the traps, register number and geographical coordinates of the trap polygon) of its authorized tuna traps referred to in paragraph 56. 59. Each CPC shall notify the ICCAT Secretariat, after the establishment of the ICCAT record of traps, of any addition to, any deletion from and/or any modification of the ICCAT record of traps at any time such changes occur. 60. The ICCAT Secretariat shall take any measure to ensure availability of the record through electronic means, including placing it on the ICCAT website, in a manner consistent with confidentiality requirements noted by CPCs. ICCAT Record of farms authorized to operate for bluefin tuna 61. The ICCAT Secretariat shall maintain an ICCAT Record of all tuna farms authorized to operate for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. For the purposes of this Recommendation, tuna farms not entered into the Record are deemed not to be authorized to operate for bluefin tuna. 62. Each farm CPC shall submit electronically to the ICCAT Secretariat, as part of their farming plan defined in paragraph 10 d), the list of its authorized bluefin tuna farms, including: i. the name of the farm; ii. register number; 161 iii. names and addresses of owner(s) and operator(s); iv. the input and total farming capacity allocated to each farm; v. the geographical coordinates of the areas authorized for farming activities; and vi. the status of the farm (active or inactive). 63. No farming activities, including feeding for fattening purposes or harvesting of bluefin tuna, shall be authorized outside of the geographical coordinates approved for farming activities. 64. Each CPC shall notify the ICCAT Secretariat of any addition to, any deletion from and/or any modification of the ICCAT Record of farms at any time such changes occur. 65. The ICCAT Secretariat shall take any measure to ensure availability of the record through electronic means, including placing it on the ICCAT website, in a manner consistent with confidentiality requirements noted by CPCs. 66. Each CPC shall take the necessary measures to ensure that no bluefin tuna is placed into a farm not authorized by the CPC or listed in the ICCAT Record and that the farms do not receive bluefin tuna from vessels that are not included in the ICCAT Record of vessels referred to in paragraph 48. Each CPC shall take the necessary measures, under their applicable legis lation, to prohibit any operation on farms not registered in the ICCAT Record of farms. Information on fishing activities 67. By 15 July each year, or within 7 months of the completion of the fishing season for those CPCs that end their fishing campaign in July, each CPC shall notify the ICCAT Secretariat detailed information on bluefin tuna catches in the eastern Atlantic and the Med iterranean in the preceding quota allocation period. This information should include: a) the name and ICCAT number of each catching vessel; b) the period of authorization(s) for each catching vessel; c) the total catches of each catching vessel including nil returns throughout the period of authorization(s); d) the total number of days each catching vessel fished in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean throughout the period of authorization(s); and e) the total catch outside their period of authorization (bycatch). 68. For all vessels that were not authorized to fish actively for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean but that caught bluefin tuna as bycatch, the following information shall be provided to the ICCAT Secretariat: a) the name and ICCAT number or national registry number of the vessel, if not registered with ICCAT; b) the total catches of bluefin tuna. 69. Each CPC shall notify the ICCAT Secretariat of any information concerning vessels not covered in paragraphs 67 and 68 but known or presumed to have fished for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The ICCAT Secretariat shall forward such information without delay to the flag CPC for appropriate action, with a copy to other CPCs for information. Joint fishing operations 70. Any joint fishing operation for bluefin tuna shall only be authorized with the express written consent of the CPCs concerned. To be authorized, each purse seine vessel shall be equipped to fish for bluefin tuna, to have a specific individual quota allocation, and to operate in accordance with the requirements defined in paragraphs 71 and 73. The quota allocated to a given JFO, shall be equal to the total of all the quotas allocated to purse seine vessels participating in the concerned JFO. Furthermore, the duration of the JFO shall not be longer than the duration of the fishing season for purse seine vessels, as referred to under paragraph 28 of this Recommendation. 162 71. At the moment of the application for the authorization, following the format set in Annex 5, and via the form developed by the Secretariat , each CPC shall take the necessary measures to obtain from its purse seine vessel(s) participating in the joint fishing operation the following information: - the period of authorization of the JFO; - the identity of the operators involved; - the individual vessels’ quotas; - the allocation key between the vessels for the catches involved; and - information on the farms of destination. Each CPC shall transmit all the information referred above to the ICCAT Secretariat at least five working days before the start of the purse seine vessels fishing season as defined in paragraph 28. In the case of force majeure , the deadline set out in this paragraph shall not apply regarding the information on the farms of destination. In such cases, CPCs shall provide the ICCAT Secretariat with an update of that information as soon as possible, together with a description of the events constituting force majeure. The ICCAT Secretariat shall compile the information referred under this paragraph provided by CPCs for the review by the Compliance Committee. CPCs are allowed to transfer the unused quotas of vessels participating in a JFO to vessels participating in another JFO, provided that such transfer is necessary due to force majeure and made prior to the start of the JFO receiving the unused quota. 72. The Commission shall establish and maintain an ICCAT record of all JFOs authorized by the CPCs in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. 73. No JFOs between purse seine vessels from different CPCs shall be permitted. However, a CPC with less than five authorized purse seine vessels may authorize joint fishing operations with any other CPC. Each CPC conducting a JFO shall be responsible and accountable for the catches made under this JFO. Part IV: Control measures Section B - Catches and transhipments Recording requirements 74. The masters of catching vessels shall maintain a bound or electronic fishing logbook of their operations in accordance with the requirements set out in Section A of Annex 2. 75. The masters of towing vessels, auxiliary vessels and processing vessels shall record their activities in accordance with the requirements set out in Sections B, C and D of Annex 2. Catch reports sent by masters and trap operators 76. Each CPC shall ensure that its catching vessels fishing actively for bluefin tuna shall communicate to their authorities during the whole period in which they are authorized to fish bluefin tuna by electronic or any other effective means daily information from logbooks, including the date, time, location (latitude and longitude), the weight and number of bluefin tuna caught in the area covered by this plan, including releases and discards of dead fish under the minimum size referred to in paragraph 33. Masters shall send that information in the format set out in Annex 2 or through the CPCs reporting requirement. 77. Masters of purse seine vessels shall produce reports referred to in paragraph 76 on a fishing operation by fishing operation basis, including operations where the catch was zero. The reports shall be transmitted by the operator to its flag CPC authorities by 9.00 GMT for the preceding day. 163 78. Trap operators or their authorized representatives fishing actively for bluefin tuna shall send electronically a daily catch report, including the ICCAT register number, date, time, catches (weight and number of fish), including zero catches. They shall se nd that information within 48 hours electronically in the format set out in Annex 2 to their flag CPC authorities during the whole period they are authorized to fish bluefin tuna. 79. For catching vessels other than purse seine vessels and traps, masters shall transmit to their control authorities, reports referred to in paragraph 76 by the latest Tuesday noon for the preceding week ending Sunday. Designated ports 80. Each CPC who has been allocated a bluefin tuna quota shall designate ports where landing or transhipping operations of bluefin tuna are authorized. This list shall be communicated each year to the ICCAT Secretariat as part of the annual fishing plan communicated by each CPC. Any amendment shall be communicated to the ICCAT Secretariat. Other CPCs may designate ports in which landing or transhipping operations of bluefin tuna is authorized and communicate a list of these ports to the ICCAT Secretariat. 81. For a port to be determined as a designated port, the port State shall ensure that the following conditions are met: a) established landing and transhipment times; b) established landing and transhipment places; and c) established inspection and surveillance procedures ensuring inspection coverage during all landing and transhipment times and at all landing and transhipment places in accordance with paragraph 85. 82. It shall be prohibited to land or tranship from catching vessels as well as processing vessels and auxiliary vessels any quantity of bluefin tuna fished in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean at any place other than ports designated by CPCs in accor dance with paragraphs 80 and 81. However, exceptionally, the transport of dead bluefin tuna, harvested from a trap/cage, to a processing vessel using an auxiliary vessel, is not prohibited. 83. On the basis of the information received by CPCs under paragraph 80 the ICCAT Secretariat shall maintain a list of designated ports on the ICCAT website. 84. The provisions of this Recommendation shall not affect the entry of a CPC fishing vessel to port, in accordance with international law, for reasons of force majeure or distress. Prior notification of landings 85. Prior to entry into any port, masters of catching vessels as well as processing vessels and auxiliary vessels or their representative shall provide the relevant authorities of the port, at least 4 hours before the estimated time of arrival, with the following: a) the external identification number and the name of the fishing vessel; b) the date and estimated time of arrival at port; c) the port of destination and the purposes of the call, such as landing, transhipment or access to services; d) estimate of quantity of bluefin tuna retained on board; e) the information on the geographic area where the catch was taken. The CPC where the landing takes place may set a shorter period for the prior notification, considering the distance between the area of activity and the port or landing site, and provided that such shorter period of prior notification does not impair the ability of that CPC to carry out inspections. 164 Where catches are taken between the time of the prior notification and arrival at port, the estimated quantities of bluefin tuna retained on board may be modified at any time prior to arrival. CPCs may decide to apply these provisions only to catches equal to or greater than three fish or one ton provided that they include this information in their monitoring, control and inspection plan referred to in paragraph 10. CPCs that decide, pursuant to this paragraph, to set a shorter period for prior notification shall provide this information, including detail of the possible shortened period and the reasons therefore and the rest of the conditions set for the prior notification, prior to implementation in their monitoring, control, and inspection plan referred to in paragraph 10. Any subsequent changes shall be notified to the ICCAT Secretariat at least 14 days before the change takes effect. Port State authorities shall keep a record of all prior notices for a period of one year from the date of Port entry. All landings shall be controlled by the relevant control authorities and a percentage shall be inspected based on a risk assessment system involving quota, fleet size and fishing effort. Full details of this control system adopted by each CPC including the target percentage of landings to be inspected shall be detailed in their annual inspection plan referred to in paragraph 10 of this Recommendation. After each trip, Masters of catching vessels shall submit within 48 hours a landing declaration to the competent authorities of the CPC where the landing takes place and to its flag CPC. The master of the authorized catching vessel shall be responsible and certify its completeness and accuracy of the declaration, which shall indicate, as a minimum requirement, the quantities of bluefin tuna landed and the area where they were caught. All landed catches shall be weighed and not only estimated. The relevant authority shall send a record of the landing to the flag CPC authority of the catching vessel, within 48 hours after the landing has ended. Reporting of catches from CPCs to the ICCAT Secretariat 86. CPCs shall send bi -weekly catch reports by gear, c overing the two weeks' activity, and through the relevant activity periods, without delay, to the ICCAT Secretariat, to ensure the data publication deadline specified below can be met. In the case of purse seine vessels and traps, the reports shall be as defined in paragraphs 76 to 78. Total reported catches will be published by t he ICCAT Secretariat on a password protected area of the ICCAT web site during the second week of each month. If there are no catches over the reporting period, and for purse seiners and traps only, the bi-weekly catch report should include a notification of nil catches. 87. CPCs shall report to the ICCAT Secretariat the dates when their entire quota of bluefin tuna has been utilized. The ICCAT Secretariat shall promptly circulate this information to all CPCs. Cross check 88. CPCs shall verify inspection reports and observer reports, VMS data, and where appropriate eBCDs, as well as the timely submission of logbooks and required information recorded in the logbooks of their fishing vessels, in the transfer/transhipment document and in the catch documents. The competent authorities shall carry out cross checks by species on all landings, transhipment, transfers and caging between the quantities recorded in the fishing vessel logbook or in the transhipment declaration and the quantities recorded in the landing declaration or caging declaration, and any other relevant documentation, such as invoice and/or sales notes. Transhipment 89. Transhipment operations of bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean shall be allowed only at designated ports defined and conditioned in paragraphs 80 to 84. 165 90. Prior to entry into any port, the receiving fishing vessel, or its representative, shall provide the relevant authorities of the port State at least 72 hours before the estimated time of arrival, with the information listed in Annex 3, according to the port State's domestic law. Any transhipment requires the prior authorization from the flag CPC of the transhipping fishing vessel concerned. Furthermore, the master of the transhipping fishing vessel shall, at the time of the transhipment, inform its flag CPC of the data required in Annex 3. 91. The relevant authority of the port State shall inspect the receiving vessel on arrival and check the cargo and documentation related to the transhipment operation. 92. The masters of fishing vessels shall complete and transmit to their flag CPC the ICCAT transhipment declaration no later than 5 working days after th e transhipment in port as per Recommendation by ICCAT on transhipment (Rec. 21-15). The masters of the transhipping fishing vessels shall complete the ICCAT transhipment declaration in accordance with the format set out in Annex 3 . The transhipment declaration shall be linked with the eBCD to facilitate cross-checking of data contained thereof. 93. The relevant authority of the port State shall send a record of the transhipment to the flag CPC authority of the transhipping fishing vessel, within 5 days after the transhipment has ended. 94. All transhipments shall be inspected by the relevant authorities of the designated port CPC authorities. Part IV: Control measures Section C - Observer Programmes CPC Observer Programme 95. Each CPC shall ensure that CPC observers, issued with an official identification document, are deployed on vessels flying its flag and on traps under its jurisdiction that are active in the bluefin tuna fishery, to achieve at least the following coverage rates: - 20% of its active pelagic trawlers (over 15 m); - 20% of its active longline vessels (over 15 m); - 20% of its active baitboats (over 15 m); - 100% of its towing vessels; - 100% of harvesting operations from its traps. 96. CPCs with less than five catching vessels of the first three segments defined above shall ensure coverage by observers 20% of the time the vessels are active in the bluefin tuna fishery. 97. In implementing this CPC observer programme, CPCs shall ensure that: a) temporal and spatial coverage is representative to ensure that the Commission receives adequate and appropriate data and information on bluefin tuna catch, effort, and other related scientific and management aspects, taking into account characteristics of the fleets and fisheries; b) robust data collection protocols are implemented; c) the CPC observer is provided, before the start of his/her deployment, with a list of contacts within the CPC competent authority where to report observations; d) each CPC observer is properly trained and qualified before deployment; e) to the extent practicable, the operations of vessels and traps concerned suffer minimal disruption; f) the master of the fishing vessel or the trap operator allows the CPC observer access to the electronic means of communication on board the fishing vessel or on the trap. 98. Data and information collected under each CPC’s observer programme shall be provided to the SCRS and the Commission, as appropriate, in accordance with requirements and procedures to be developed by the Commission by 2023 taking into account CPC confidentiality requirements. 166 99. For the scientific aspects of the programme, the SCRS shall report on the coverage level achieved by each CPC, and provide a summary of the data collected and any relevant findings associated with that data. The SCRS shall also provide any recommendations to improve the effectiveness of CPC’s observer programmes. 100. The obligations, responsibilities and tasks applicable to the CPC observers are detailed in Annex 6. ICCAT Regional Observer Programme (ROP) 101. The ICCAT Regional Observer Programme referred to in Annex 6 shall be implemented to ensure 100% observer coverage as follows: - on all purse seine vessels authorized to fish for bluefin tuna; - during all transfers of bluefin tuna from purse seine vessels to transport cages; - during all transfers of bluefin tuna from traps to transport cages; - during all transfers from one farm cage to transport cages, which then are towed to another farm; - during all cagings of bluefin tuna in farms; - during all harvesting of bluefin tuna from farms; and - during the release of bluefin tuna from farms. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 95, for releases of tuna from farms, only the regional observer, and not the national observer, shall be present on the towing vessel. Notwithstanding the above, when, for reasons of force majeure (e.g., pandemic) duly notified to ICCAT, the deployment of a regional observer is not possible, the vessel, trap or farm may operate without the observer. In such cases, CPCs shall prioritize such vessels, farms, and traps for control and inspection. In addition, CPCs shall implement a set of appropriate alternative measures aimed at achieving the objectives of the regional observer programme, including, where possible, deploying either a national inspector or a national observer to act in locum of the regional observer. The CPC concerned shall send all details of the alternative measures to the Secretariat. The Secretariat shall compile and circulate all the information received on the implementation of these procedures to the Commission. Such alternat ive measures and the actions taken will be examined by the Compliance Committee during each annual meeting. 102. By way of derogation from paragraph 101, harvesting from farms up to 1000 kg per day and up to a maximum of 50 tons per farm per year to supply the fresh bluefin tuna market may be authorized by the relevant CPC provided that an authorized inspector from the farm CPC is onsite for 100% of such harvests, and controls the entire operation. The authorized inspector shall also validate the harvested quantities in the eBCD system. In this case, the regional observer’s signature should not be required in the harv est section of the eBCD. This derogation shall be reviewed, as appropriate, by the PWG, possibly through its Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures (IMM), by 2027 at the latest. 103. Purse seine vessels without an ICCAT regional observer on board shall not be authorized to fish or to operate in the bluefin tuna fishery. 104. One ICCAT regional observer shall be assigned to each farm for the entirety of caging and harvesting operations. In cases of force majeure that have been confirmed by the farm CPC authority, or in cases where neighboring farms, as authorized and controlled by the farm CPC, operate jointly as one unit , an ICCAT regional observer may be shared by more than one farm to guarantee the continuity of farming operations if so authorized by the farm CPC competent authority. 167 105. By way of derogation from paragraph 104, in case of transfer between two different farms under the competence of the same national authority, a single regional observer can be assigned to cover the entire process including the transfer of fish to a towing transport cage, the towing of the fish from the donor farm to the recipient farm and the caging of fish on the recipient farm. In this case, a regional observer should be deployed by the donor farm and the cost shall be shared by both the donor and receiving farms, unless otherwise determined by the farming companies. 106. As a matter of priority, the ICCAT regional observers should not be of the same nationality as the catching vessel, towing vessel, trap or farm, for which their services are required and, to the extent possible, the ICCAT Secretariat and the provider responsible for the ROP shall ensure the observer has a satisfactory knowledge of the language of the flag, fishing vessel and farm or trap CPC. The requirements that the regional observer not be of the same nationality as the observed vessel, farm or trap will only take priority in cases where the ICCAT regional observers deployed have a satisfactory knowledge of the language of the flag, fishing vessel, farm or trap CPC. If it is not possible to find foreign observers with proper language skills or in case of force majeure, the deployment of ICCAT regional observers of the same nationality may be allowed, provided that prior notification to the ICCAT Secretariat is made by the provider responsible for the ROP. 107. The obligations, responsibilities and tasks applicable to the ICCAT Regional Observer and the flag, trap, and farm CPCs are detailed in Annex 6. Part IV: Control measures Section D – Transfers of live fish General provisions 108. This section applies to all transfers as defined in paragraph 2 i) of this Recommendation. 109. In accordance with paragraph 10 c) of this Recommendation, each CPC shall nominate a single competent authority, hereafter referred to as the “CPC competent authority”, that shall be responsible for coordinating the collection and verification of information for the control of transfers and related transports of bluefin tuna conducted under its jurisdiction, and for reporting to and cooperating with the CPCs whose farms will cage the fish. 110. Masters of catching and towing vessels carrying out transfer operations shall report their transfer activities in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex 2 (logbook). Unique number assigned to cages 111. All cages used in transfer operations and associated transports shall be numbered in accordance with the unique numbering system referred to in paragraphs 147 to 150. Prior Transfer Notification 112. Before the start of a transfer operation, including voluntary transfers, the master of the catching or towing vessel or its representative, or the representative of the farm or trap, where the transfer in question originates shall send to its CPC competent authority a prior transfer notification indicating, where applicable: - the number and the estimated weight of bluefin tuna to be transferred; - the name of the catching vessel, towing vessel(s), farm or trap, with their respective ICCAT number record; - the date and the location of the catch; - the date and estimated time of transfer; - the estimated position (latitude/longitude) where the transfer will take place and the donor and receiving cage numbers; - farm of destination; 168 - the name and ICCAT number of the donor farm, in the case of a transfer from the farm cage to a transport cage; - the numbers of the two farm cages and any transport cages involved, in the case of intra -farm transfers. Transfer authorization 113. Within 48 hours following the submission of the prior transfer notification, the CPC competent authority of the donor operator shall assign and communicate to the donor operator concerned a transfer authorization number for each transfer operation. The transfer authorization number shall include the three CPC letters code, four numbers for the year and three letters to indicate either positive (AUT) or negative (NEG) authorization, followed by sequential numbers. 114. The transfer operation concerned shall not start before its specific transfer authorization number has been assigned and communicated to the donor operator. 115. The transfer authorization does not prejudge the confirmation of any subsequent transfer or caging operation. 116. Voluntary and control transfers shall not be subject to a new transfer authorization. Refusal of a transfer operation and consequent release of bluefin tuna 117. A transfer operation shall not be authorized by the CPC competent authority of the donor operator if, on receipt of the prior transfer notification, it considers that: a) the catching vessel or the trap declared to have caught the fish does not have a valid authorization to fish for bluefin tuna, issued in accordance with paragraph 56 of this Recommendation; b) the number and weight of fish subject to the transfer has not been duly reported by the catching vessel or the trap; c) the catching vessel or the trap that has caught the fish does not have sufficient quota; d) the towing vessel declared to transfer and/or transport the fish is not registered in the ICCAT Record of all other fishing vessels referred to in paragraph 48 b), or is not equipped with a fully functioning Vessel Monitoring System (VMS); e) the farm of destination is not reported as active in the ICCAT Record of farms referred to in paragraph 63 of this Recommendation. 118. In case of refusal, the CPC competent authority of the donor operator shall: a) immediately inform the donor operator of the refusal, as well as the catch, the trap or farm CPC competent authority, if different; b) where applicable, issue an order to release the fish concerned into the sea, in accordance with Annex 10. Monitoring of transfers operations by video camera 119. Except for transfers of cages between two towing vessels, which do not involve the movement of live tuna between those cages, the donor operator shall ensure that the transfer operation is monitored by video camera in the water, in accordance with the mini mum standards and procedures referred to in Annex 8, to determine the number of individuals of bluefin tuna being transferred. 120. Each donor operator CPC shall take the necessary measures to ensure that identical copies of the relevant video records are provided without delay by the donor operator: a) for the first transfer operation and the eventual voluntary or control transfer, to the ICCAT regional observer and to the receiving towing vessel and, at the end of the fishing trip, to the flag or trap CPC competent authority of the donor operator; 169 b) for further transfers, to the CPC observer on board the donor towing vessel, to the master of the receiving towing vessel and, at the end of the towing trip, to the flag CPC competent authority of the donor towing vessel; c) for transfers between two different farms, to the ICCAT regional observer, to the receiving towing vessel and to donor farm CPC competent authority; and d) if a national or ICCAT inspection authority is present during the transfer operation, the inspector(s) shall also receive a copy of the relevant video record. 121. The video footage concerned shall accompany the fish up to the destination farm. A copy shall be kept onboard the donor vessel(s), by the trap(s) or by the farm(s), and remain accessible for control purposes at any time during the fishing campaign. 122. Copies of the video records shall be provided by the CPC competent authority of the donor operator to the SCRS upon request. The SCRS shall keep confidentiality of commercial activities. 123. The CPC competent authority of the donor operator and the donor operator shall retain the video footages related to transfers for at least 3 years, and keep them as long as necessary for control and enforcement purposes. Voluntary and control transfers 124. If the video footage does not meet the minimum standards referred to in Annex 8, and in particular if its quality and clarity are not sufficient to determine the number of fish being transferred, the donor operator may conduct voluntary transfer(s). 125. If no voluntary transfer(s) has been carried out, or if the voluntary transfer(s) still does not permit a determination of the number of fish being transferred, the CPC competent authority of the donor operator shall order a control transfer, which shall b e repeated until the quality of the video record allows the estimation of the number of bluefin tuna being transferred. 126. The voluntary and/or control transfer(s) shall be carried out into another cage which must be empty. The number of fish obtained from the valid voluntary or control transfer shall be used to complete the logbook, the ICCAT Transfer Declaration (ITD) and the relevant sections of the eBCD. 127. The separation of the transport cage from a purse seine, a trap, or a farm cage shall not occur before the ICCAT regional observer on board the purse seiner, or present on the farm or trap, has carried out its tasks. 128. However, if after the voluntary transfer(s) the quality of the video still does not allow determination of the number of individuals being transferred, the CPC competent authority of the donor operator may allow the separation of the donor purse seine vessel, trap or farm from the transport cage(s). In such a case, the CPC competent authority of the donor operator shall order the door(s) of the transport cage(s) concerned, to be sealed in accordance with the procedure set out in Annex 14, and require a control transfer(s) to be carried out at a determined time and place, in the presence of the flag, trap or farm competent authority. 129. In the event that the flag, trap or farm competent authorities cannot be present at the control transfer, the control transfer shall take place in the presence of an ICCAT regional observer. In this case, the responsibility for the regional observer deploy ment shall lie with the farm operator owning the bluefin tuna transported, who shall ensure that the regional observer is deployed to verify the control transfer. ICCAT Transfer Declaration (ITD) 130. At the end of a transfer operation, the donor operator shall complete an ITD in accordance with the format set out in Annex 4. The donor operator shall transmit or make available, without delay, the ITD to its CPC competent authority, to the ICCAT regional observer where its presence is mandatory and, where applicable, to the master of the towing vessel or the farm receiving the fish. 170 131. The CPC competent authority of the donor operator shall ensure that the ITD form is numbered, using the three letters CPC code, followed by the four numbers showing the year and three sequential numbers, followed by the three letters ITD (CPC-20**/xxx/ITD). 132. The original of the ITD shall accompany the fish transferred up to the destination farm(s) where the fish will be caged: a) at first transfer, the original of the ITD shall be duplicated by the donor operator when a single catch is transferred from the purse seine net or the trap to more than one transport cage; b) in the case of a further transfer, the master of the donor towing vessel shall update the ITD by completing part 3 (further transfers) and provide the updated ITD to the receiving towing vessel(s). The ITD shall be duplicated by the master of the donor towing vessel if the fish subject to further transfer is divided into more than one transport cage. 133. A copy of the ITD shall be kept onboard the donor catching or towing vessel(s), or by the donor trap or the donor farm, and be accessible at any time for control purposes during the duration of the fishing campaign. Investigation by the CPC competent authority of the donor operator 134. The CPC competent authority of the donor operator shall investigate all cases where: a) there is more than 10% difference between the number of fish reported in the ITD by the donor operator and the number of fish estimated by the ICCAT regional observer, or by the CPC national observer, as appropriate; or b) when the ICCAT regional observer has not signed the ITD. The margin of error of 10% referred above shall be expressed as a percentage of the donor operator’s figures. 135. Where applicable, the investigation shall include the analysis of all the relevant video footages. Except in cases of force majeure, the investigation shall be concluded within 96 hours of its initiation, and in any case prior to the arrival of the transport cage to the destination farm. 136. At the initiation of an investigation, the CPC competent authority of the donor operator shall inform the flag CPC competent authority of the towing vessel(s) concerned about the investigation, and ensure that, until the investigation is concluded, no tran sfer is permitted from or to the transport cage in question. 137. For all transfer operations where a video is required, a differen ce greater than 10% , between the number of bluefin tuna reported by the donor operator in the ITD and the number determined by the CPC competent authority of the donor operator following an investigation, shall constitute a Potential Non-Compliance (PNC) of the fishing vessel, trap or farm concerned. Amendments to ITDs and eBCDs following inspections at sea or investigations 138. If following an inspection at sea or an investigation, the number of fish is found to be more than 10% different to that declared in the ITD and eBCD, the eBCD shall be amended by the CPC competent authority of the donor operator to reflect the result of the investigation. Fish that die during transfer operations and associated transport 139. The number of fish that die during a transfer operation, or during the transport of the fish to the destination farm, shall be reported by the donor operator in accordance with the procedures and template set out in Annex 11. 171 Part IV: Control measures Section E – Caging General provisions 140. Each farm CPC shall nominate a single competent authority, hereafter referred to as the “farm CPC competent authority”. That authority shall be responsible for coordinating the collection and verification of information on national caging activities, for the control of farm activities conducted under its jurisdiction, and for reporting to and cooperati ng with the CPC competent authorities whose flag vessels or trap caught the caged tuna. 141. Where the farms are located beyond waters under the jurisdiction of a CPC, the provisions of this section shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the CPCs where the natural or legal persons responsible for the farm are located. 142. All farm activities shall be subject to the control described in the monitoring, control and inspection plan submitted under paragraph 10 of this Recommendation. 143. All CPCs involved in caging related activities shall exchange information and cooperate to ensure that the number and weight of bluefin tuna intended for caging are accurate, consistent with the catch amounts reported by the purse seine vessel or trap, and declared in the relevant sections of the eBCD. 144. Farm CPCs are encouraged to exchange experience and best practices on control and inspection related to farming activities using the pilot program for the voluntary exchange of inspection personnel established by the Resolution by ICCAT amending the Resolution (18 -11) by ICCAT establishing a pilot program for the voluntary exchange of inspection personnel in fisheries managed by ICCAT (Res. 19-17). 145. The farm CPC competent authority shall ensure that farm operators maintain at all times an accurate schematic plan of their farms, indicating the unique number of all cages and their individual position on the farm. The plan shall be made available at all times to the farm CPC competent authority for control purposes. Any modification to the schematic plan is subject to prior notification to the farm CPC competent authority. The schematic farming plan shall be adapted any time the number and/or distribution of farm cages is modified. 146. The farm CPC competent authority and the farm operator shall retain all the information, documentation and material related to caging activities conducted in farms under its jurisdiction for at least 3 years, and keep the information as long as necessary for enforcement purposes. Unique number assigned to cages 147. Before the start of the bluefin tuna fishing campaign, the farm CPC competent authority shall assign a unique and identifiable number to each cage associated to farms under its jurisdiction, including those cages used to transport the fish to the farm. 148. Each cage shall be identified with a unique numbering system that includes at least the three letters CPC code, followed by three numbers. The unique cage numbers shall be stamped or painted on two opposite sides of the ring of the cage and above the water line, in a color contrasting with the background on which they are painted or stamped, and must be visible and legible at any time for control purposes. 149. The height of the letters and numbers shall be at least 20 centimeters with a line thickness of at least 4 centimeters. 150. Alternative methods to mark the unique number on the cage are allowed, providing they offer the same guarantee of visibility, legibility and inviolability. 172 Caging authorization 151. Each caging operation is subject to a caging authorization issued by the farm CPC competent authority. The following procedure shall apply: a) the farm operator requests a caging authorization to the farm CPC competent authority, specifying in particular the number and weight (as referred to in the ITD) of fish to be caged. This request shall be accompanied by: i. the relevant ITDs; ii. the eBCD(s) reference concerned, as confirmed and validated by the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority; iii. all the reports of fish that die during transport, duly recorded in accordance with Annex 11. b) the farm CPC competent authority notifies the information under subparagraph a) to the relevant catching flag or trap CPC(s) competent authority(ies), and asks for confirmation that the caging operation can be authorized; c) within three working days, the catching flag or trap CPC(s) competent authority(ies) notifies the farm CPC competent authority that the caging operation concerned can be authorized or must be refused. In the case of refusal, the flag or trap CPC competent authority shall specify the reason(s) for the refusal, and the refusal shall include the consequent release order; d) the farm CPC competent authority issues the caging authorization immediately after receipt of the confirmation by the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority concerned. The caging operation shall not be authorized by the farm CPC competent authority in the absence of this confirmation. 152. No caging shall be authorized if the complete set of documentation required under paragraph 151 a) does not accompany the fish subject to the caging authorization. 153. Pending the results of the investigation referred to in paragraphs 134 to 137 conducted by the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority, the caging operation shall not be authorized and the relevant catch and live trade sections of the eBCD shall not be validated. 154. If the caging authorization has not been issued by the farm CPC competent authority within 1 month after the request for a caging authorization by the farm operator, the farm CPC competent authority shall order and proceed to release all the fish contained in the transport cage concerned, in accordance with Annex 10. The farm CPC competent authority shall accordingly inform without delay the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority concerned, and the ICCAT Secretariat of the release. Refusal of a caging authorization by the flag or trap CPC 155. If, on receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 151 a) the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority considers that: a) the catching vessel or trap declared to have caught the fish had insufficient quota to cover the bluefin tuna to be caged; b) the fish to be caged has not been duly reported by the catching vessel or trap, and has not been taken into account for the calculation of any quota uptake that may be applicable; c) the catching vessel or trap declared to have caught the fish does not have a valid authorization to fish for bluefin tuna, issued in accordance with paragraph 56 of this Recommendation; it shall determine the number of fish for which caging is refused and request without delay the farm CPC competent authority to proceed to seize the fish concerned and immediately release them into the sea, in accordance with Annex 10. 173 Caging operations 156. At arrival of the towing vessel in the vicinity of the farm, the farm CPC competent authority shall ensure that: a) the towing vessel and cage concerned are maintained at a distance of minimum 0.1 nautical mile from any facility of the farm until the farm CPC competent authority is physically present; and b) the position and activity of the relevant towing vessels is monitored at all times. 157. No caging operation shall start: a) before it has been duly authorized by the farm CPC competent authority; b) without the presence of the farm CPC competent authority and the ICCAT regional observer; c) before the catch and live trade sections of the eBCD have been completed and validated by the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority(ies). 158. The anchoring of transport cages as farm cages, without movement of fish to allow stereoscopic camera recording is prohibited. 159. After transfer of the bluefin tuna from the towing cage to the farm cage, the farm CPC control authority shall ensure that farm cages containing bluefin tuna are sealed at all times. Unsealing will only be possible in the presence of the farm CPC competent authority and following its authorization. The farm CPC control authority shall establish protocols for the sealing of farm cages, ensuring the use of official seals and that these seals are placed in such a way that they prevent the opening of doors without the seals being broken. 160. Farm CPCs shall ensure that the bluefin tuna catches are placed in separate cages, or series of cages, and partitioned on the basis of flag CPC of origin and catch year. By derogation, if the bluefin tuna has been caught in the context of a JFO, the catches concerned shall be placed in separate cages or series of cages and partitioned on the basis of the JFOs and catch year. 161. All the caging operations shall be completed before 22 August of each year, unless the farm CPC receiving the fish provides valid reasons, including force majeure. Those reasons shall be documented and reported in the caging report referred to in paragraph 188. The above deadlines do not apply in case of inter-farm transfers. Recording of the caging operation by control cameras 162. The farm CPC competent authority shall ensure that each bluefin tuna caging operation in its farms is recorded by the farm operator using both conventional and stereoscopic cameras. All video footages shall comply with the minimum standards set out in Annex 8, except point 1d for stereoscopic camera footages. 163. If the quality of the control camera video footage used to determine the number and/or weight of the bluefin tuna caged does not comply with the minimum standards of Annex 8 , the farm CPC competent authority shall order a control caging until the determination of the number and/or weight is possible. The repetition of the caging operation shall not be subject to a new caging authorization. 164. In the event of persistent turbidity conditions in the farm area, the farm CPC competent authority may authorise the control caging to take place outside the farm, in an adjacent area where there is sufficient visibility. CPCs shall document the measuremen t of the turbidity according to standard methods. 174 165. In the case of control caging, the farm CPC competent authority shall ensure that the donor farm cage is sealed and that the cage cannot be manipulated prior to the new caging operation. The receiving farm cage(s) used in the control caging shall be empty. 166. At the completion of the caging operation, the farm CPC competent authority shall ensure that the ICCAT regional observer has immediate access to all stereoscopic and conventional camera video footage(s), and is allowed to make a copy if it intends to complete its task of analysing the footage at another time or place. 167. CPCs with active bluefin tuna farms and the SCRS are encouraged to participate in trials using AI , including under the framework established by Resolution by ICCAT on a pilot project for the short-term live storage of bluefin tuna (Res. 22-07), for the analysis of stereoscopic camera footage, with a view to automating the determination of the number and/or weight of caged tuna, in order to reduce workloads and avoid possible human bias. Fish that die during a caging operation 168. All bluefin tuna that die during a caging operation shall be reported by the farm operator, in accordance with the procedures set out in Annex 11. Caging declaration 169. Each farm CPC competent authority shall ensure that, for each caging operation, the farm operator submits a caging declaration within 1 week after the actual caging operation has taken place, using the form set out in Annex 12. Analysis of the stereoscopic video footage by the farm CPC competent authority 170. The farm CPC competent authority shall determine the number and weight of bluefin tuna being caged, by analyzing the video footage of each caging operation provided by the farm operator. To carry out this analysis, the authorities shall follow the procedures set out in point 1 of Annex 9. 171. When there is a difference of more than 10% between the number and/or the weight determined by the farm CPC competent authority and the corresponding figures reported in the caging declaration, the farm CPC competent authority shall launch an investigation to identify the reasons for the discrepancy, and make the eventual adjustment to the number and/or weight of fish that has been caged. 172. The margin of error of 10% referred to above shall be expressed as a percentage of the farm operator’s figures. 173. As soon as the technological developments are considered robust and ready for commercial scale -up, as well as the SCRS establishes the technical criteria, and guidelines for their selection, the SCRS shall evaluate the accuracy of video analysis softw are that incorporates AI and estimates the bluefin tuna length and provide advice to the Commission for its consideration. Communication of caging results to the catching flag or trap CPC 174. After the completion of a caging operation or, in the case of a JFO or traps of a same CPC/EU Member State, of the last caging operation associated to that JFO or those traps, the farm CPC competent authority shall send to the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority the results of the caging operations referred to in Annex 9, point 2 under a and b. 175. Each farm CPC competent authority shall submit the procedures and results related to the stereoscopic camera programme (or alternative methods) to the SCRS by 31 October annually. The SCRS should evaluate such procedures and results and report to the Commission at the next Annual Meeting. 175 Investigation conducted by the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority 176. When, for a single catching operation, the number of bluefin tuna being caged as communicated by the farm CPC competent authority in accordance with paragraph 174, differs by more than 10% from those reported in the ITD or eBCD as caught and/or transferred , the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority shall initiate an investigation to determine the accurate catch weight that shall be deducted from the national bluefin tuna quota, in accordance with paragraphs 182 to 184 (quota uptake). 177. In support of this investigation, the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority shall request all the complementary information, and the results of the relevant video footage analysis conducted in accordance with this Recommendation by the flag and farm CPCs competent authority(ies) that have been involved in the transport and the caging operation concerned. 178. All CPCs competent authorities, including those whose vessels have been involved in the transport of the fish, shall cooperate actively, including through the exchange of all information and documentation at their disposal. 179. The catching flag or trap CPC competent authority shall conclude the investigation within 1 month from the communication of the caging results by the competent authority of the farm CPC. 180. A difference greater than 10% between the number of bluefin tuna reported caught by the vessel or trap concerned and the number determined by the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority as result of the investigation shall constitute a PNC of the vessel or trap concerned. 181. The margin of error of 10% referred to above shall be expressed as a percentage of the figures reported by the fishing vessel master or trap representative and shall be applicable at the level of individual caging operation. Quota uptake 182. The catching flag or trap CPC competent authority shall determine the weight of bluefin tuna to be deducted from its national quota taking into account the quantities caged, calculated in accordance with the provisions of Annex 9 , which ensures that weight at caging is calculated based on the length-weight relationship for wild fish, and the reported mortalities, in accordance with the provisions of Annex 11. 183. However, for those cases where the investigation referred to in paragraph 176 concludes that bluefin tuna individuals were missing within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Annex 11, the weight of the missing fish shall be deducted from the national quota in accordance with Annex 11, by applying the average individual weight at caging communicated by the farm CPC competent authority, to the number of bluefin tuna in the catch as determined by the flag or trap CPC competent authority resulting from its analysis of the first transfer video footage in the context of the investigation. 184. Notwithstanding paragraph 183, after the consultation of the CPC competent authority(ies) involved in the transport of fish up to the destination farm, the flag or trap CPC competent authorities may decide not to deduct from the national quota the fish determined in the investigation as having been lost, when the losses have been duly documented as “ force majeure” by the operator (i.e., pictures of the damaged cage, meteorological reports), the relevant information has been communicated to its CPC competent authority immediately after the event and the losses did not result in known mortalities. Releases associated to caging operations 185. The determination of the fish to be released shall be done in accordance with the provisions of Annex 9 paragraph 4. 176 186. If the weight of bluefin tuna being caged is in excess of what had been declared as caught and/or transferred, the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority shall issue a release order and communicate it without delay to the farm CPC competent authority concerned . The release order shall follow the provisions of Annex 9 paragraph 4, taking into account the possible compensation at the JFO or trap level, in accordance with Annex 9 paragraph 5. 187. The release operation shall be conducted in accordance with the protocol set out in Annex 10. Caging report 188. Within 15 days after the completion of the release orders, the farm CPC competent authority shall issue a caging report for each single caging operation, or in the case of a JFO or traps of the same CPC/EU Member State, for the complete set of caging opera tions related to that JFO or those traps. The caging report shall include the information referred to in Annex 9 paragraph 3 and be communicated to the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority and to the ICCAT Secretariat. Part IV: Control measures Section F. Harvesting 189. Processing vessels intending to operate in farms or traps shall send a prior notification to the farm or trap CPC competent authorities at least 48 hours before arrival of the vessel to the farm/trap area. The prior notification shall at least include the date and estimated time of arrival and information as to whether the processing vessel already has bluefin tuna on board, and, if so, provide details on the cargo, including quantities in processed weight and live weight and details of the origin of the bluefin tuna on board (farm/trap and CPC). 190. Any harvesting operation in farms or traps shall be subject to an authorisation by the farm or trap CPC competent authority. To this end, the farm or trap operator intending to harvest bluefin tuna shall submit to its CPC competent authority a request, which shall include at least the following information: - date or period of harvesting; - estimated quantities to be harvested in number of individuals and kg; - eBCD number associated with the bluefin tuna to be harvested; - details of auxiliary vessels involved in the operation; - destination of harvested tuna (processing vessel, export, local market, etc.). 191. Except for individuals of bluefin tuna which are close to dying, no harvesting operation shall be authorized before the results of the quota uptake in accordance with paragraphs 182 to 184 has been determined, and the associated releases have been conducted. 192. Harvesting operations shall not take place without the presence of a CPC observer in the case of traps, or an ICCAT regional observer in the case of harvesting on farms. For fish delivered to a processing vessel, the CPC or ICCAT regional observer may conduct its relevant tasks from the processing vessel. 193. Farm or trap CPC control authorities shall verify and cross -check the results of all harvesting operations taking place in farms and traps under its authority, using all relevant information in its possession. Farm or trap CPC control authorities shall in spect all harvesting operations of bluefin tuna destined for processing vessels and a percentage of the rest of harvesting operations based on risk analysis. 194. When the destination of the bluefin tuna is a processing vessel, the master or representative of the processing vessel shall complete a processing declaration. When the harvested bluefin tuna is to be landed directly into port, the farm or trap operator sh all complete a harvesting declaration. The processing and harvesting declarations shall be validated by the ICCAT regional or CPC observer present at the harvesting operation. 177 195. The pro cessing declaration and harvesting declaration shall contain at least the following information using Annex 15: - date of harvesting; - farm or trap; - cage(s) number(s); - number of individuals harvested; - live weight and processed weight in Kg of the harvested bluefin tuna; - eBCD number(s) associated with the bluefin tuna harvested; - details of auxiliary vessels involved in the operation; - destination of the harvested tuna (i.e., export, local market, or other); - validation by the ICCAT regional observer or CPC observer, as appropriate. 196. The processing and harvesting declarations shall be sent by e -mail to the farm CPC competent authorities within 48 hours of the harvesting operation. 197. The Commission shall consider reflecting “Processing on board” in the eBCD at its 2023 Annual Meeting. To this end, IMM WG and then eBCD TWG shall discuss the technical, administrative and control requirements and report the results to the Commission. Part IV: Control measures Section F – Control activities in farms after caging Intra-farm transfers 198. Intra-farm transfer shall not take place without the authorization of the farm CPC competent authority. Each transfer shall be recorded by control cameras to confirm the number of bluefin tuna individuals transferred. The video footage shall comply with the minimum standards as laid down in Annex 8. The farm CPC competent authority shall monitor those transfers, including by verifying the video footage and ensuring that each intra-farm transfer is recorded in the eBCD system. 199. A difference by number of bluefin tuna individuals between the number resulting from the intra-farm transfer and the expected number shall be duly investigated by the farm CPC competent authority and recorded in the eBCD system. In the case of excess numbe r, the farm CPC competent authority shall order the release of the corresponding number of fish. The release operation shall be conducted in accordance with Annex 10. Compensation for differences between different cages on the farm shall not be allowed. A margin of error of up to 5% between the number of individuals resulting from the intra-farm transfer and the expected number in the cage, may be allowed by the CPC competent authority. 200. Notwithstanding the definition of caging in paragraph 2 s), the relocation of bluefin tuna between two different locations on the same farm (intra -farm transfer) using a transport cage, shall not be considered caging for the purposes of the requirements set out in Section E. 201. During intra -farm transfers, regrouping fish of the same flag origin and the same JFO, may be authorised by the farm CPC competent authority, providing that traceability, as established in paragraph 160, and the applicability of SCRS’s growth rates, are maintained. 202. The farm CPC competent authority and the farm operator shall retain the video footages from intra - farm transfers undertaken in farms under their jurisdiction for a minimum of 3 years and keep the information as long as necessary for enforcement purposes. 178 Carry-over 203. Prior to the beginning of the next purse seiner and trap fishing seasons, the farm CPCs competent authority shall thoroughly assess the live bluefin tuna carried -over in the farms under their jurisdiction. To this end, the live bluefin tuna concerned shall be transferred to an empty cage and monitored using control camera(s), to determine the number and the weight of fish transferred. 204. By way of derogation, the carry-over of bluefin tuna from years and cages where no harvest occurred shall be controlled annually by applying the random control procedure referred to in paragraphs 211 to 218. 205. The live bluefin tuna carried-over shall be placed in separate cages or series of cages in the farm, on the basis of the catch year and JFO/same CPC trap of origin. 206. The farm CPC competent authority shall ensure that the control camera video footage from the carry- over assessment transfers comply with the relevant requirements of Annex 8, and the determination of the number and weight of carried -over fish is in accordance with Annex 9 point 1 of this Recommendation. 207. Until the SCRS develops an algorithm to convert length into weight for fattened and/or farmed fish, the determination of the weight of the carried -over fish shall be estimated using the most updated growth rates tables produced by the SCRS. 208. A difference by number of bluefin tuna individuals between the number resulting from the carry-over assessment and the expected number after harvest shall be duly investigated by the farm CPC competent authority and recorded in the eBCD system. In the case of excess number, the farm CPC competent authority shall order the release of the corresponding number of fish. The release operation shall be conducted in accordance with Annex 10. Compensation for differences between different cages on the farm shall not be allowed. A margin of error of up to 5% between the number of individuals resulting from the carry -over assessment and the expected number in the cage, may be allowed by the CPC competent authority. This percentage shall be reviewed, as appropriate, by the IMM by 2027 at the latest. The Commission shall consider revising the percentage based on the recommendation from the IMM. 209. The farm CPC competent authority shall retain the video footage and all the relevant documentation from carry-over assessments undertaken in farms under their jurisdiction for a minimum of 3 years, and keep this information as long as necessary for enforcement purposes. Carry-over declaration 210. Farm CPCs shall complete and transmit, as an annex to the revised farming management plan, an annual carry-over declaration to the ICCAT Secretariat within 15 days after the end of the assessment operation. Such declaration shall include: a) Flag CPC; b) Name and ICCAT number of the farm; c) Year of catch; d) References of the eBCD corresponding to the catches carried over; e) Cage numbers; f) Quantities (expressed in kg) and number of fish carried over; g) Average weight; h) Information of each of the carry-over assessment operations: date and cage numbers; i) Information on previous intra-farm transfers, when applicable. The stereoscopic camera report, when applicable, shall be attached to the carry-over declaration. 179 Random controls 211. The farm CPC competent authority shall carry out random controls in farms under their jurisdiction. The minimum random controls referred to in paragraph 212 shall take place in farms between the time of completion of the caging operations and the first cag ing of the following year. Such controls shall involve the compulsory transfers of all fish from farm cage(s) to other farm cage(s) in order that the number of bluefin tuna individuals can be counted by way of control video record(s). 212. Each farm CPC shall set a minimum number of random controls to be performed on each farm under its sovereignty. The number of random controls shall cover at least 10% of the number of cages in each farm after completion of caging operations, always involvi ng at least one control per farm and rounded up where needed. The selection of cages to be controlled shall be based on risk analysis. The planning for random controls to be carried out shall be reflected in the CPC control plan referred to under paragraph 10 of this Recommendation. 213. Although not required, the farm(s) concerned may be informed by the farm CPC competent authority with a maximum prior notice of two calendar days that random control(s) shall take place. The selected cage(s) shall only be communicated by the farm CPC compe tent authority to the farm operator upon arrival at the farm concerned. 214. Where prior notice is given, farm operators shall ensure that all means are in place in order that random controls can be carried out by the farm CPC competent authority at any time, and in any cage on the farm. If prior notice is not provided, farm operat ors must still take all appropriate steps to facilitate the random control operations. 215. The farm CPC competent authority shall strive to reduce the timeframe between the ordering of the random controls and when the control operations is carried out. The farm CPC competent authority shall ensure that all necessary measures are taken to ensure that the operator does not have the possibility to manipulate the cages concerned until the random control takes place. 216. Following the random control, any difference between the number of bluefin tuna determined by the random controls and the number expected to be present in the cage shall be duly investigated and recorded in the eBCD system. In the case of excess number, th e farm CPC competent authority shall order the release of the corresponding number(s). The release operation shall be conducted in accordance with Annex 10. Compensation for differences between different cages on the farm shall not be allowed. A margin of error of 5% between the number of individuals resulting from the control transfer and the expected number in the cage, may be allowed by the CPC competent authority. This percentage shall be reviewed, as appropriate, by the IMM at the latest by 2027. The Commission shall consider revising the percentage based on the recommendation from the IMM. 217. The farm CPC competent authority shall retain all video footage from random controls undertaken in farms under their jurisdiction for a minimum of 3 years, and keep this information as long as necessary for enforcement purposes. 218. The results of the random controls shall be communicated to the ICCAT Secretariat before the start of the new purse seine fishing season applicable to each CPC in accordance with paragraph 28, for transmission to the Compliance Committee. Inter-farm transfers 219. The transfer of live bluefin between two different farms shall not take place without the prior written authorisation by the CPC competent authorities of both farms. 220. The transfer from the donor farm cage to the transport cage shall comply with the requirements of Section D (Transfers of live fish), of this Recommendation, including a video record to confirm the number of bluefin tuna individuals transferred, the comple tion of an ITD and the verification of the operation by an ICCAT Regional Observer. Notwithstanding the above, in cases where the entire farm cage is to be moved to the receiving farm, it shall not be necessary to video record the operation and the cage shall be transported sealed to the destination farm. 180 221. The caging of the bluefin tuna at the farm of destination shall be subject to the requirements for caging operations laid down in paragraphs 156 to 173 , including a video record to confirm the number and weight of the bluefin tuna caged and the verification of the operation by an ICCAT Regional Observer. The determination of the weight for caged fish from another farm, shall not apply until the SCRS has developed an algorithm to convert length into weight for fattened and/or farmed fish. Part IV: Control measures Section G - Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) 222. CPCs shall implement a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) for their fishing vessels with a length equal to or greater than 15 m referred to in paragraph 2 a) of this Recommendation, in accordance with the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning minimum standards for vessel monitoring systems in the ICCAT Convention area (Rec. 18-10), including the obligation to transmit at least once every hour for purse seine vessels and at least once every two hours for all other fishing vessels. 223. Notwithstanding the above, all towing vessels used to transport live bluefin tuna shall, irrespective of their length, install and operate a VMS, in accordance with Rec. 18 -10, and transmit messages at least once every hour. 224. The transmission of VMS data to the ICCAT Secretariat by each authorized fishing vessel subject to VMS under this Recommendation shall: a) start at least 5 days before and continue at least 5 days after their period of authorization, unless the vessel is removed from the lists of authorized vessels by the flag CPC competent authority; and b) not be interrupted when the vessel is in port, for control purposes, unless there is a system of hailing in and out of port. 225. The ICCAT Secretariat shall immediately inform the flag CPC of any delays or non -receipt of VMS transmissions, and distribute monthly reports to all CPCs with specific information on the nature and the scope of these delays. Such reports shall be sent weekly during the period 1 May to 30 July. 226. Referring to towing vessels during the transport of bluefin tuna to a farm, in the event of a technical failure of its VMS, the towing vessel concerned shall be replaced by another towing vessel with a fully functioning VMS. If no other towing vessel is av ailable, a new operative VMS system shall be installed on board or used if already installed, as soon as feasible and not later than 72 hours, except in case of force majeure, that should be communicated to the ICCAT Secretariat. In the meantime, the maste r or his representative shall, starting from the time that the event was detected and/or informed, communicate to the control authorities of the flag CPC every 1 hour the up -to-date geographical coordinates of the towing vessel by appropriate telecommunication means. Use of VMS data for control and inspection purposes 227. The ICCAT Secretariat shall make available without delay the information received under this section G to CPCs with an active inspection presence in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean and to the SCRS, at its request. 228.

CPCs shall take appropriate enforcement measures with respect to a fishing vessel, where it has been established, in accordance with its law that the fishing vessel flying its flag does not comply with the provisions of this Recommendation. The measures shall be commensurate with the gravity of the offence and in accordance with the pertinent provisions of national law in such a way as to make sure that they effectively deprive those responsible of the economic benefit derived from their infringement without prejudice to the exercise of their profession. Those sanctions shall also be capable of producing results proportionate to the seriousness of such infringement, thereby effectively discouraging further offences of the same kind. 230. The farm CPC shall take appropriate enforcement measures with respect to a farm, where it has been established, in accordance with its law, that the farm does not comply with the provisions of this Recommendation. Depending on the gravity of the offence and in accordance with the pertinent provisions of national law such measures may include, in particular, suspension of the authorization or withdrawal from the ICCAT Record of bluefin tuna farming facilities establi shed in accordance with paragraph 61 and/or fines. Part IV: Control measures Section I - Market measures Market measures 231. Consistent with their rights and obligations under international law, exporting and importing CPCs shall take the necessary measures: - to prohibit domestic trade, landing, imports, exports, placing in cages for farming, re -exports and transhipments of eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna that are not accompanied by accurate, complete, and validated documentation required by thi s Recommendation, the Recommendation by ICCAT amending and replacing Recommendation 18-13 on an ICCAT bluefin tuna catch documentation program (Rec. 23-21) and the Rec. 24 -16 on the Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation Programme. - to prohibit domestic trade, imports, landings, placing in cages for farming, processing, exports, re - exports and the transhipment within their jurisdiction, of eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna caught by fishing vessels or traps whose CPC doe s not have a quota or catch limit for that species, under the terms of ICCAT management and conservation measures, or when the CPC’s fishing possibilities are exhausted, or when the individual quotas of catching vessels referred to in paragraph 3 are exhausted. - to prohibit domestic trade, imports, landings, processing, and exports of eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna from farms that do not comply with the provisions related to farming specified in this Recommendation. 182 Part V: ICCAT Scheme of Joint International Inspection 232. In the framework of the Multi -annual management plan for bluefin tuna, each Contracting Party agrees, in accordance with Article IX, paragraph 3, of the ICCAT Convention, to apply the ICCAT Scheme of Joint International Inspection adopted during its 4th Re gular Meeting, held in November 1975 in Madrid, as modified in Annex 7. 233. The Scheme referred to in paragraph 232 shall apply until ICCAT adopts a monitoring, control and surveillance scheme which will include an ICCAT scheme for joint international inspection, based on the results of the IMM Working Group, established by the Resolution by ICCAT for Integrated Monitoring Measures (Res. 00-20). 234. When at any time, more than 15 fishing vessels of any one Contracting Party are engaged in eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishing activities in the Convention area, the Contracting Party shall, on the basis of risk assessment have an inspection vessel in the Convention area, or shall cooperate with another Contracting Party to jointly operate an inspection vessel. If a Contracting Party does not deploy its inspection vessel or conducting joint operations, the Contracting Party shall report the result of the risk assessment and its alternative measures in its inspection plan referred to in paragraph 10. 235. In cases where enforcement measures need to be taken as a result of an inspection, the enforcement powers of the flag Contracting Party inspectors of the fishing vessel, farm or trap subject to inspection shall always prevail in their territory, in their j urisdictional waters and on board their inspection platform.

Serious violations 1. For the purposes of these procedures, a serious violation means the following violations of the provisions of the ICCAT conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission: a) fishing without a license, permit or authorization issued by the flag CPC; b) failure to maintain sufficient records of catch and catch -related data in accordance with the Commission’s reporting requirements or significant misreporting of such catch and/or catch - related data; c) fishing in a closed area; d) fishing during a closed season; e) intentional taking or retention of species in contravention of any applicable conservation and management measure adopted by the ICCAT; f) significant violation of catch limits or quotas in force pursuant to the ICCAT rules; g) using prohibited fishing gear; h) falsifying or intentionally concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel; i) concealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to investigation of a violation; j) multiple violations which taken together constitute a serious disregard of measures in force pursuant to the ICCAT; k) assault, resist, intimidate, sexually harass, interfere with, or unduly obstruct or delay an authorized inspector or observer; l) intentionally tampering with or disabling the vessel monitoring system; m) such other violations as may be determined by the ICCAT, once these are included and circulated in a revised version of these procedures; n) fishing with the assistance of spotter planes; o) interference with the satellite monitoring system and/or operation of a vessel without a VMS system; p) transfer activity without transfer declaration; q) transhipment at sea; r) not providing to ICCAT inspectors a boarding ladder meeting the requirements of IMO Resolution A.889(21) to facilitate safe access to any fishing vessel which requires a climb of 1.5 metres or more. 2. In the case of any boarding and inspection of a fishing vessel during which the authorized inspectors observe an activity or condition that would constitute a serious violation, as defined in paragraph 1 of this Annex, the authorities of the flag CPC of the inspection vessel shall immediately notify the flag CPC of the fishing vessel, directly as well as through the ICCAT Secretariat. In such situations, the inspector should also inform any inspection ship of the flag CPC of the fishing vessel known to be in the vicinity. 3. ICCAT inspectors should register the inspections undertaken and the infringements detected (if any) in the fishing vessel logbook. 4. The flag CPC shall ensure that, following the inspection referred to in paragraph 2 of this Annex, the fishing vessel concerned ceases all fishing activities. The flag CPC shall require the fishing vessel to proceed within 72 hours to a port designated by it, where an investigation shall be initiated. 5. In the case where an inspection has detected an activity or condition that would constitute a serious violation, the vessel should be reviewed under the procedures described in the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 21 -13 on establishing a list of vessels presumed to have carried out illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities (Rec. 23 -16), taking into account any response actions and other follow up. 201 II. Conduct of inspections 6. Inspections shall be carried out by inspectors designated by the Contracting Governments. The names of the authorized government agencies and individual inspectors designated for that purpose by their respective governments shall be notified to the Commission. 7. Ships carrying out international boarding and inspection duties in accordance with this Annex shall fly a special flag or pennant approved by the Commission and issued by the ICCAT Secretariat. The names of the ships so used shall be notified to the ICCAT Secretariat as soon as practical in advance of the commencement of inspection activities. The Secretariat shall make information regarding designated inspection vessels available to all CPCs, including by posting on its password-protected website. 8. Inspectors shall carry appropriate identity documentation issued by the authorities of the flag CPC, which shall be in the form shown in paragraph 21 of this Annex. 9. Subject to the arrangements agreed under paragraph 16 of this Annex, a vessel flagged to a Contracting Government and fishing for tuna or tuna -like fishes in the Convention area outside waters under national jurisdiction shall stop when given the appropriate signal in the International Code of Signals by a ship flying the ICCAT pennant described in paragraph 7 of this Annex and carrying an inspector unless the vessel is actually carrying out fishing operations, in which case it shall stop immediately once it has finished such operations. The master* of the vessel shall permit the inspection party, as specified in paragraph 10 of this Annex, to board it and must provide a boarding ladder meeting the requirements of IMO Resolution A.889(21), to facilitate safe and convenient access to any vessel which requires a climb of 1.5 metres or more. For compliance with the requirements of boarding ladders, a transitional period is allowed for vessels operating in the Atlantic, until January 2024. The master shall enable the inspection party to make such examination of equipment, catch or gear and any relevant documents as an inspector deems necessary to verify compliance with the ICCAT Commission’s Recommendations in force in relation to the flag C PC of the vessel being inspected. Further, an inspector may ask for any explanations that he or she deems necessary. 10. The size of the inspection party shall be determined by the commanding officer of the inspection vessel taking into account relevant circumstances. The inspection party should be as small as possible to accomplish the duties set out in this Annex safely and securely. 11. Upon boarding the vessel, inspectors shall produce the identity documentation described in paragraph 8 of this Annex. Inspectors shall observe generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to the safety of the vessel being inspected and its crew, and shall minimize interference with fishing activities or stowage of product and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board. Inspectors shall limit their enquiries to th e ascertainment of the observance of the Commission’s Recommendations in force in relation to the flag CPC of the vessel concerned. In making the inspection, inspectors may ask the master of the fishing vessel for any assistance he/she may require. Inspect ors shall draw up a report of the inspection in a form approved by the Commission. Inspectors shall sign the report in the presence of the master of the vessel who shall be entitled to add or have added to the report any observations which he or she may think suitable and must sign such observations. 12. Copies of the report shall be given to the master of the vessel and to the government of the inspection party, which shall transmit copies inspection reports with apparent infringements to the appropriate authorities of the flag CPC of the inspected vessel and to the ICCAT Commission. Where any infringement of ICCAT Recommendations is discovered, the inspector should, where possible, also inform any inspection ship of the flag CPC of the fishing vessel known to be in the vicinity. 13. CPCs deploying inspection vessels under this scheme shall submit each year by 15 September in relation to activity occurring between 1 January and 31 December of the previous year a list of the inspections carried out in the form to be provided by the Secretariat. * Master refers to the individual in charge of the vessel. 202 14. Resistance to inspectors or failure to comply with their directions shall be treated by the flag CPC of the inspected vessel in a manner similar to such conduct committed with respect to a national inspector. 15. Inspectors shall carry out their duties under these arrangements in accordance with the rules set out in this Recommendation, but they shall remain under the operational control of their national authorities and shall be responsible to them. 16. Contracting Governments shall consider and act on inspection reports, sighting information sheets as per Recommendation by ICCAT on vessel sightings (Rec. 19 -09) and statements resulting from documentary inspections of foreign inspectors under these arrang ements on a similar basis in accordance with their national legislation to the reports of national inspectors. The provisions of this paragraph shall not impose any obligation on a Contracting Government to give the report of a foreign inspector a higher evidential value than it would possess in the inspector’s own country. Contracting Governments shall collaborate in order to facilitate judicial or other proceedings arising from a report of an inspector under these arrangements. a) Contracting Governments shall inform the Commission by 15 February each year of their provisional plans for conducting inspection activities under this Recommendation in that calendar year and the Commission may make suggestions to Contracting Governments for the coordination of national operations in this field including the number of inspectors and ships carrying inspectors; b) the arrangements set out in this Recommendation and the plans for participation shall apply between Contracting Governments unless otherwise agreed between them, and such agreement shall be notified to the ICCAT Commission. Provided, however, that implemen tation of the scheme shall be suspended between any two Contracting Governments if either of them has notified the ICCAT Commission to that effect, pending completion of such an agreement. 17. a) the fishing gear shall be inspected in accordance with the regulations in force for the subarea for which the inspection takes place. Inspectors will state the subarea for which the inspection took place, and a description of any violations found, in the inspection report; b) inspectors shall have the authority to inspect all fishing gear in use or on board. 18. Inspectors shall affix an identification mark approved by the Commission to any fishing gear inspected which appears to be in contravention of the Commission’s Recommendations in force in relation to the flag CPC of the vessel concerned and shall record this fact in his/her report. 19. The inspector may photograph the gears, equipment, documentation and any other element he/she considers necessary in such a way as to reveal those features which in their opinion are not in conformity with the regulation in force, in which case the subjec ts photographed should be listed in the report and copies of the photographs should be attached to the copy of the report to the flag CPC. 20. Inspectors shall, as necessary, inspect all catch on board to determine compliance with ICCAT Recommendations. 203 21.

Each flag, trap and farm CPC concerned shall ensure that the following procedures apply to all video recordings of transfer, caging and/or release operations referred to in this Recommendation: a) At the beginning and/or the end of each video, where requested, the ICCAT transfer or caging authorization number or release order shall be displayed; b) The time and the date of the video shall be continuously displayed throughout each video record; c) The video record shall be continuous without any interruptions and cuts, and cover the entire transfer, caging and/or release operation; d) Before the start of the transfer, caging and/or release operation, the video record shall include the opening and closing of the net/door and, for transfers and caging operations, show whether the receiving and donor cage(s) already contain bluefin tuna; e) The video record shall be of sufficient quality to determine the number and, where appropriate the weight, of bluefin tuna being transferred, caged and/or released; f) A copy of the video record shall be kept on board the donor vessel, or by the farm or trap operator where appropriate, during their entire period of authorization to operate; g) The distribution of copies of the video records shall follow the provisions referred to in paragraphs 120 to 123 of this Recommendation; h) The electronic storage device containing the original video record shall be immediately provided to the ICCAT regional and/or CPC national observer after the end of the transfer, caging and/or release operation. The ICCAT regional observer and/or CPC obser ver shall immediately initialize it to avoid any further manipulation. 2. Each flag, trap and farm CPC concerned shall establish the necessary measures to avoid any replacement, edition or manipulation of the original video records. Insufficient quality of the video record 3. If the video record is of insufficient quality to determine the number and, where appropriate the weight, of bluefin tuna being transferred, caged and/or released, the operation shall be repeated until the quality of the video is adequate, following the procedures below: a) for a transfer, the transfer operation concerned shall be repeated in accordance with the provisions set out in paragraphs 124 to 129 of this Recommendation (voluntary and control transfers). This voluntary or control transfer shall be carried out into ano ther cage which must be empty. For those transfers where the origin of the fish is a trap, the bluefin tuna already transferred from the trap to the receiving cage could be sent back to the trap and the voluntary transfer is cancelled under the supervision of the ICCAT regional observer; b) for a caging operation, the caging operation concerned shall be repeated in accordance with the provisions set out in paragraphs 163 and 165 of this Recommendation. 205 The new caging operation must include movement of all the bluefin tuna from the receiving farm cage into another farm cage, which must be empty; c) for releases, the segregation of the fish to be released shall be repeated in accordance with the release Protocol set out in Annex 10 of this Recommendation. 206 Annex 9 Standards and procedures for stereoscopic cameras systems in the context of caging operations 1. Use of stereoscopic cameras systems The use of stereoscopic cameras systems in the context of caging operations shall be conducted in accordance with the following provisions: i. The sampling intensity of live fish for length measurement shall not be below 20% of the number of fish being caged. When technically possible, the sampling of live fish shall be sequential, by measuring one in every five specimens. Such a sample shall be made up of fish measured at a distance between 2 and 8 meters from the camera. ii. The dimensions of the transfer gate connecting the donor cage and the receiving cage shall be set at maximum width of 8 to 10 meters and maximum height of 8 to 10 meters. iii. Validation of the stereoscopic individual length measurements shall be undertaken prior to each caging operation using a scale bar at a distance of 2 and 8 m. iv. When the length measurements of the fish present a multi -modal distribution (two or more cohorts of distinct sizes), it shall be possible to use more than one conversion algorithm for the same caging operation. v. The most up to date algorithm(s) established by SCRS using the length -weight relationship for wild fish shall be used to convert the fork length into weight, according to the size category of the fish measured during the caging operation. vi. The margin of error for determining weight, inherent to the technical specifications of the stereoscopic camera system, shall not exceed a range of +/- 5 percent. vii. The report on the results of the stereoscopic program should include details on all the technical specifications above, including the sampling intensity, the way of sampling methodology, the distance from the camera, the dimensions of the transfer gate, and the algorithms (length-weight relationship). The SCRS shall review these specifications, and if necessary provide recommendations to modify them. 2. Caging results At the completion of a caging operation, or the complete set of caging operations under a JFO or under the traps of the same CPC/EU Member State, the farm CPC competent authority shall communicate the following information to the catching flag or trap CPC competent authority: a) a technical report related to the stereoscopic camera system, which shall contain in particular: - general information: species, site, cage, date, algorithm; - sizing statistical information: average weight and length, minimum weight and length, maximum weight and length, number of fish sampled, weight distribution, size distribution; - the algorithm used to convert length into weight; - the margin of error of the stereoscopic camera system used. In the case where the camera software does not have an automatic method to calculate this margin of error, it shall be calculated as detailed in points 1 to 4 of the Appendix to this Annex. b) a factual report related to the caging operation, which shall contain in particular: - detailed results of the sampling programme, with the total number and weight of bluefin tuna being caged, and the size and weight of every fish that was sampled; - the relevant caging declarations; - indication of cases where discrepancies of more than 10% between the number of individuals being caged and the number reported as caught on the ITD require investigation 207 by the flag or trap CPC competent authority in accordance with paragraph 176, and cases where the caging results indicate that catch is not in line with paragraphs 33 to 35; - general information on the caging operation: number of the caging operation, name of the farm, cage number, eBCD number, ITD number, name and flag of the catching vessel, name and flag of the towing vessel, date of the stereoscopic camera system operation and footage filename; - comparison between the amounts declared in the eBCD and the amounts found with the stereoscopic camera system, in number of fish, average weight and total weight (the formula used to calculate the difference shall be: (Stereoscopic System-eBCD)/Stereoscopic System* 100). 3. Caging Report The caging report referred to in paragraph 188 of this Recommendation shall include: a) the caging results referred to in point 2; b) the relevant reports of the release operations, conducted in accordance with Annex 10; 4. Use of the outcome of the stereoscopic camera systems By applying the margin of error inherent to the technical specifications of the stereoscopic camera system used, the farm CPC competent authority shall determine the range (lowest and higher value) of the total weight of the bluefin tuna being caged, in accordance with point 5 of the Appendix to this Annex. When receiving the results of the analysis of the stereoscopic camera video footage and the range (lower and higher value) of the total weight of the bluefin tuna being caged, communicated by the farm CPC competent authority, the catching flag or trap CPC/ EU Member State competent authority shall take the following measures: a) apply the following measures as regards releases and adaptation of the eBCD sections for catching vessels operating within the framework of an individual fishing operation (outside a JFO); i. when the total weight declared by the catching vessel in the eBCD is within the range of the stereoscopic camera system results: ­ no release shall be ordered; ­ the eBCD shall be modified both in number (using the number of fish resulting from the use of the stereoscopic camera system) and average weight, while the total weight shall not be modified. ii. when the total weight declared by the catching vessel in the catching section of the eBCD is below the lowest figure of the range of the stereoscopic camera system results: ­ a release shall be ordered using the lowest figure in the range of the stereoscopic camera system results; ­ the release operations shall be carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down in Annex 10; ­ after the release operations took place, the eBCD shall be modified both in number (using the number of fish resulting from the use of the stereoscopic camera system minus the number of fish released) and average weight, while the total weight shall not be modified. iii. when the total weight declared by the catching vessel in the catching section of the eBCD exceeds the highest figure of the range of the stereoscopic camera system results: 208 ­ no release shall be ordered; ­ the eBCD shall be modified for the total weight (using the highest figure in the range of the stereoscopic camera system results), for the number of fish (using the results from the stereoscopic camera system), and average weight accordingly. b) ensure that for any relevant modification of the eBCD, the values (number and weight) entered in Section 2 shall be consistent with those in Section 6 and the values in Sections 3, 4 and 6, shall not be higher to those in Section 2. 5. Provisions applicable to JFO and traps 1. Decisions consequent to differences between the catch report and the results from the stereoscopic camera system programme shall be taken by the flag or trap CPC competent authority: a) based on comparison between the total of the weights resulting from the stereoscopic camera system programme of all the bluefin tuna caging operations from a JFO / traps, with the total of the weights of catches declared by vessels participating in that JF O or by those traps and, in the case of JFOs and traps involving a single CPC and/or EU Member State; b) at the level of the caging operations for JFOs involving more than one CPC and/or EU Member State, unless otherwise agreed by all the flag CPC/EU Member State competent authorities of the catching vessels involved in the JFO. 2. In case of compensation of differences in weight between what has been determined by the stereoscopic camera and the correspondent catch found in individual caging reports across all cagings from a JFO or traps of a same CPC/EU Member State, whether or not a release operation is required, all relevant eBCD shall be modified on the basis of the lowest range of the stereoscopic camera system results. 3. The eBCD related to the quantities of bluefin tuna released shall also be modified to reflect the weight and the corresponding number of fish released. The eBCD related to bluefin tuna not released but for which the results from the stereoscopic camera sys tems or alternative techniques differ from those reported caught and transferred shall also be amended to reflect these differences. 4. The eBCD relating to the catches from where the release operation took place shall also be modified to reflect the weight/number released. 5. CPC farm authorities may authorize the harvesting of fish from some of the cages, after analysing the videos of those cages and before the completion of the verification of all cages from that JFO. To proceed, the eBCD of the cage to be harvested shall be adjusted within the lower range of the results of the stereoscopic camera system. Any discrepancy from the initially declared quantity will be taken into account when analysing all data from that JFO. 209 Appendix to Annex 9 Method for the calculation of a margin of error and range of the stereoscopic camera system In accordance with what was agreed at the Intersessional Meeting of Panel 2 (March 2 020), the following method is applied for the calculation of the margin of error and the range of the stereoscopic camera system: 1. Calculation of the fork length (FLi) range for each sample (i) taking into account the margin of error FL provided by the system (error%): The length range is identified for each sample (i) by [FLmin,i , FLmax,i] FLmin,i = FLi-(FLi*error%): is the minimum value for the fork length range for each sample (i) FLmax,i = FLi+ (FLi*error%): is the maximum value for the fork length range for each sample (i) 2. Conversion of the length range to a round weight (RTW) range for each sample (i) applying the algorithm used to convert length into weight: The round weight range is identified for each sample (i) by [RTWmin,i , RTWmax,i] RTWmin,i : is the minimum value of the round weight range for each sample (i) RTWmax,i : is the maximum value of the round weight range for each sample (i) 3. Calculation of the average round weight range: the average round weight range for «n» samples is identified by [RTWaveragemin, RTWaveragemax] RTWaveragemin = 𝟏 𝒏∑ 𝑹𝑻𝑾𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑖𝒏 𝒊=𝟏 : is the minimum value for the average round weight range RTWaveragemax = 𝟏 𝒏∑ 𝑹𝑻𝑾𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑖𝒏 𝒊=𝟏 : is the maximum value for the average round weight range 4. Calculation of the margin of error percentage (%) of the system: (𝑹𝑻𝑾𝒂𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒈𝒆𝑚𝑎𝑥− 𝑹𝑻𝑾𝒂𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒈𝒆𝑚𝑖𝑛)/𝟐 𝑹𝑻𝑾𝒂𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒈𝒆 ∗𝟏𝟎𝟎 RTWaverage: is the average weight provided by the stereoscopic camera 5. Deduction of the stereoscopic camera system range: The range of the stereoscopic camera system is defined by: [The lowest figure of the range, The highest figure of the range] Previously, the total weight is calculated by multiplying the average weight provided by the stereoscopic camera by the number of fish resulting from the use of the stereoscopic camera, i.e. RTWtotal = (RTWaverage* Number BFT) Thus, the range limits are calculated as follows: The lowest range figure = RTWtotal – (margin of error system * RTWtotal /100) The highest range figure = totalRTW + (margin of error system *RTW total /100) 210 Annex 10 Release Protocol Issuing of release orders 1. Release orders before caging shall be issued: a) by competent authority of the donor operator when, on the basis of the prior transfer notification, the CPC competent authority of the donor operator refuses the transfer operation as per paragraph 117; or b) by the farm CPC competent authority when, in accordance with paragraph 154, the caging authorization has not been issued by the farm CPC competent authority within 1 month after the request for a caging authorization. 2. Release orders after caging shall be issued: a) by the flag or trap CPC competent authority when, following procedures in paragraph 185 to 187 it is established that the weight caged exceed that reported caught. The release order shall be notified to the farm CPC competent authority, which shall transmi t it to the farm operator concerned; or b) by the farm CPC competent authority when, after harvest, the remaining fish is not covered by an eBCD, or when a carry-over assessment or control transfer has identified an excess of fish. For cases under section 2 a) above, the total weight of bluefin tuna to be released shall be converted into a corresponding number of individuals by applying the average weight resulting from the analysis of the stereoscopic camera video footages related t o the relevant caging operation, made by the farm CPC competent authority in accordance with paragraph 170 of the Recommendation. Segregation of fish prior to the release operation 3. Prior to the release from a farm cage, the farm CPC competent authority shall ensure that: ­ the fish to be released is segregated and moved to an empty transport cage, and the transfer of the fish to the transport cage is monitored by control camera in the water, in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Annex 8; ­ the number of fish segregated for release corresponds to the release order. 4. The prior segregation of the fish shall be conducted in the presence of an ICCAT regional observer. Record of the release operation by video camera 5. The release of bluefin tuna from transport or farm cages into the sea shall be recorded by control camera. All release operations into the sea shall be observed by a national observer in case of releases from a transport cage before caging, or an ICCAT regional observer in case of releases after caging. Reporting 6. For each release operation performed, the donor or farm operator responsible for the release shall complete a release report, using the template attached to this Annex. 7. The ICCAT regional observer shall validate the information in the release declaration. The donor or farm operator shall submit the release declaration to its authorities within 48 hours of the release operation taking place for transmission to the ICCAT Secretariat. 211 General provisions 8. Release operations from purse seine nets, traps or transport cages must be executed immediately after receipt of the release order. 9. Release operations from farms must be executed within 3 months of the last caging operation of the fish concerned and at a minimum distance of 10 miles from the farm. For releases of less than 5 tonnes of bluefin tuna, the farm CPC competent authority may set a shorter distance, of minimum 5 miles, for the release. 10. The master of the towing vessel or the farm operator shall be responsible for the fish survival until the release operation has taken place. 11. The farm CPC competent authority might implement any additional measures they feel necessary to guarantee that the release operations take place at the most appropriate time and place in order to increase the probability of the fish going back to the stock. 12. The provisions of this Annex shall not apply to release of bluefin tuna from traps as a result of lifting of the gear at the end of the activity. 13. By way of derogation from paragraph 3 first bullet, for farms directly connected to traps, the fish to be released shall be segregated and moved to an empty cage or connected trap pool. The transfer of the fish to the empty cage or to the connected trap pool shall be monitored by control camera in the water, in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Annex 8. 14. By way of derogation from paragraph 9, the minimum distance measures shall not apply to farms directly connected to traps. 212 ICCAT Release Report Document No: 1 – CATCHING/CAGING DETAILS Farm/catching vessel/trap/towing vessel carrying out the release: ICCAT Register number: Release order reference: Catching vessel(s)/trap (1): JFO number: Caging authorisation(s) number (1): Release cage(s) number: eBCD(s) reference(s): Release authorization number: 2 – DETAILS OF THE RELEASE OPERATION Type of release (3): Date of the operation: Towing vessel name: ICCAT Register number: Flag: Segregation of fish prior to the release operation: Verification cage number: Release cage number: Number of BFT individuals released: Weight of BFT released (kg): Operator name, date and signature (2): Observer name, ICCAT No., Date and signature: Presence of Observer (Y/N) Reasons for disagreement: Rules or procedure not respected: (1) Only for releases from farms (2) Signature of the farm operator for releases from farms, or of the fishing vessel master for releases ordered to catching vessels or towing vessels (3) Release after completion of caging reports (Annex 9, paragraph 3); BFT remaining after harvesting that is not covered by an eBCD; excess of BFT found following a control transfer or carry-over assessment. 213 Annex 11 Treatment of dead and/or lost fish Record of dead or lost bluefin tuna 1.

The objective of the pilot project for farming bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus) (BFT) in the Cantabrian Sea is to assess the conditions for fishing and farming bluefin tuna in the Cantabrian Sea to inform the potential future development of such activities. 2. Research conducted as part of the pilot project should aim to provide answers to key questions related to fishing and farming of BFT in the Cantabrian Sea including, but not limited to, the following: - Assessing the functioning of technological developments of the submersible cages under extreme weather conditions. - Assessing that suitable schools (medium large fish) are available to purse seine vessels, in that area during the months July to November. - Assessing the growth and fattening of BFT in this area and exploring the potential added value of the activity, including in terms of direct fisher profits. - Assessing whether the monitoring and control of fishing, transfer and farming activities laid down by the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 22 -08 establishing a Multi-annual Management Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 24-05) are adequate and feasible to implement. 3. The pilot project shall be carried out on a limited scale, over one year, with a limited number of individuals (i.e. 50 BFT fish). 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 28 of Rec. 24-05, the fishing season for this pilot project may be extended to 30 September. 5. The precise details of the pilot project shall be included in the 2025 annual fishing, farming and 221 inspection plans established in accordance with paragraph 10 of ICCAT Recommendation 24-05. 6. The allocation from the CPC’s national quota to the pilot project shall be specified in the annual fishing plan and shall be on a limited scale and approved by Panel 2. 7. This plan shall also include details of the control measures to be put in place to ensure that the activity is carried out in line with ICCAT rules and with this Recommendation, as well as the way these rules shall be made mandatory for operators. The plan shall be analysed, and, as appropriate, endorsed by Panel 2 intersessionally (Rec. 24-05, paragraph 11). 8. The results of the pilot project shall be assessed by the Commission in 2025 to determine, in case the project delivers positive results, whether and how the commercial activity could take place beyond the pilot project stage. 9. CPCs participating in the pilot project shall submit a report on the results of the project for consideration by the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) and the Commission no later than the end of 2025. The report shall provide detailed in formation on the key questions mentioned in paragraph 2 above, as well as relevant statistical data, including the final number of BFT caught/caged and the individual length and weight of those fish at the time of capture and at the time of harvest from th e cage. The report shall also identify the challenges or difficulties encountered, including regarding data collection and monitoring, control, and surveillance. In particular, the report shall include an analysis of the suitability of the current ICCAT provisions for this activity. 10. This Recommendation repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT for a pilot project for farming bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in the Cantabrian Sea (Rec. 23-08). 222 24-07 BFT RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON AQUACULTURE BLUEFIN TUNA (Entry into force 16 June 2025) RECOGNIZING that ICCAT has established a comprehensive Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Atlantic bluefin tuna, firstly adopted in 2007, with the main aim to have effective control of the movement of bluefin tuna, strict tracking of the product from the point of c apture throughout the whole operation to its final market; ACKNOWLEDGING the critical role of the electronic Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation (eBCD) system in combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and the significant influence that market dynamics exert on the fishery; includes the necessity for complem entary market -related measures that have contributed to the recovery of these stocks from overfishing status; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the rebuilding plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna and the recovery plan for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna adopted by ICCAT in 2008, which results have now come into fruition after the recovery of the stocks and the adoption leading I CCAT to transition to a bluefin tuna Management Plan, which however requires the maintaining the same level of control on all the components involved in the bluefin tuna fisheries; MINDFUL of the rights and obligations of port States to promote the effectiveness of management measures adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs); UNDERLINING the need to establish measures that safeguard the wild bluefin tuna market by preventing loopholes in the eBCD, maintain high standards in the fight against IUU fishing, and ensure that all wild fish can be clearly distinguished from aquaculture fish; NOTING that during the 23rd Special Meeting of 2022, the Commission was informed of several CPCs’ plans to develop bluefin tuna aquaculture, either through the importation of wild bluefin tuna eggs or through full aquaculture cycles using broodstock, with this fish potentially entering the commercial market as early as 2025; CONSIDERING the current lack of information in the eBCD system regarding the origin of fish, whether wild-caught or from aquaculture; FURTHER CONSIDERING the potential impact of escapements of aquaculture bluefin tuna on wild stocks; BEARING IN MIND the discussions held in ICCAT Panel 2 and the technical deliberations by the Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures (IMM) in June 2023; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. For the purposes of this Recommendation, “aquaculture” is defined as any bluefin tuna rearing activity, either through the hatching of wild bluefin tuna eggs or through full aquaculture cycles using broodstock within a controlled system, excluding short -term live storage, farming and fattening activities as defined by Resolution by ICCAT on a pilot project for the short -term live storage of bluefin tuna (Res. 22-07) and Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 22 -08 establishing a multi-annual ma nagement plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 24-05). 223 2. Any CPC seeking to export bluefin tuna produced through aquaculture shall establish a system to distinguish between wild-caught fish including those that have been subject to short-term live storage, farming and fattening, and aquacultured fish. This system shall be detailed in an Aquaculture plan to be submitted annually to Panel 2 for its review and endorsement, as part of the reporting obligation on fishing, farming, inspection and capacity management plans for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean BFT, including details on the controllability of such system. A CPC that does not submit a fishing, farming, inspection and capacity managem ent plan in accordance with Recommendation 24-05 but wishes to conduct aquaculture operations for bluefin tuna, shall nonetheless submit an Aquaculture plan. 3. The Aquaculture plan stipulated in paragraph 2 above shall, in particular, include the following information: i. The origin of the bluefin tuna (hatching of wild bluefin tuna eggs or complete aquaculture cycle using broodstock); ii. Details on any aquaculture facilities established within waters under a CPC’s jurisdiction, including the number of structures at sea and the annual farming capacity; iii. The forecasts for the quantities of aquaculture bluefin tuna to be marketed for the reporting year. iv. The expected number and volume of fish to be produced, expected size of fish at time of harvest, and the anticipated harvest date. The measures taken to prevent caged fish from escaping and information on any environmental impact assessment that has been carried out. 4. Bluefin tuna produced through aquaculture shall be accompanied by an eBCD, in accordance with the Recommendation by ICCAT amending and replacing Recommendation 18-13 on an ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation programme (Rec. 23 -21) and the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 22 -16 amending Recommendation 21 -18 on the application of the eBCD system (Rec. 24-16). CPCs shall prohibit bluefin tuna aquaculture operators from selling or offering for sale aquacultured fish until the eBCD system has a functionality to register the fish's origin. 5. The eBCD that accompanies each bluefin tuna produced through aquaculture shall clearly identify the origin of the fish as an aquaculture product and specify the aquaculture facility involved. To facilitate this, the eBCD system rules shall be adjusted to a llow the system to register the fish's origin, whether from an aquaculture facility or, if wild, from a trap or fishing vessel. 6. CPCs carrying out aquaculture activities shall endeavour to implement strict measures to ensure separation of wild and farmed bluefin tuna populations, including maintaining genetic monitoring, controlled broodstock selection, regulated hatchery practices, and enforced protocols to prevent genetic mixing. 7. The Standing Catch Document Scheme Working Group (CDS WG) shall endeavour to propose the necessary revisions to Recommendations 24 -16 and 23 -21 to incorporate the requirements of paragraphs 4 and 5 for the Commission’s consideration in 2025. 8. At its meeting in 2027 the Commission shall review the implementation of this Recommendation and consider asking the SCRS to assess the potential impacts of bluefin tuna aquaculture undertaken under this Recommendation on the genetics of the wild stock and on the ecosystem. 9. ICCAT Panel 2 shall endeavour to propose to the ICCAT Commission the necessary amendments to Recommendation 24-05 to cater for the inclusion of an Aquaculture plan into the annual bluefin tuna plan. 10. Relevant provisions of Recommendation 24 -05, notably paragraph 10 shall apply to aquaculture activity of bluefin tuna carried out in the ICCAT Convention area. 224 25-03 BFT RESOLUTION BY ICCAT AMENDING RESOLUTION 22-07 ON A PILOT PROJECT FOR THE SHORT-TERM LIVE STORAGE OF BLUEFIN TUNA (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 18 December 2025) RECALLING that Norway during the 27th Regular Meeting of the Commission in 2021, presented a concept paper on short-term live storage of bluefin tuna; ACKNOWLEDGING that at the 2021 Annual Meeting, Panel 2 requested Norway to present a draft proposal to the Special Meeting of the Commission in 2022 on short-term live storage of bluefin tuna; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that ICCAT has adopted the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 22-08 establishing a multi-annual management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 24-05), Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 22-16 amending Recommendation 21-18 on the application of the eBCD system (Rec. 24-16) and Recommendation by ICCAT amending and replacing Recommendation 18-13 on an ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation programme (Rec. 23-21); NOTING an interest in exploring ways to (a) promote a more even distribution of bluefin tuna to prevent flooding of the market, (b) maintain the quality of bluefin tuna, and (c) maximize the utilization of bluefin tuna by preventing high quality food from being d estroyed, while ensuring the integrity of existing ICCAT Recommendations for this species; ACKNOWLEDGING that the use of short -term live storage of bluefin tuna may be an effective way to achieve these objectives and that establishing a pilot project using a precautionary approach can provide valuable scientific answers to how short -term live storage of bluef in tuna can be effectively carried out in the future; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that the research to be undertaken on the short -term live storage of bluefin tuna could result in the need for adjustments to relevant ICCAT measures or the development of new ones; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. A pilot project for the short-term live storage of bluefin tuna is authorized. 2. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as CPCs) whose vessels have been actively fishing for bluefin tuna North of 56°N, may conduct short-term live storage of bluefin tuna. 3. The objectives of short-term live storage of bluefin tuna are to maintain a high -quality product and to ensure that distribution of the fish can occur in a way that does not flood the market. 4. Research conducted as part of the pilot project should aim to provide answers to key questions related to short-term live storage of bluefin tuna, including, but not limited to, the following: - fish behavior - estimate the weight of bluefin tuna at the time of catch and caging - whether feeding is needed to ensure animal health and, if so, how to avoid fattening the bluefin tuna - extent of mortality and causes - meat quality - how to ensure traceability is consistent with the requirements of the BCD program, including exploring the use of tagging - harvesting processes - marketing questions 225 5. CPCs who wish to engage in the pilot project on short-term live storage of bluefin tuna should identify and describe the activity in their annual fishing plan, in accordance with the multi-annual conservation and management plan for eastern Atlantic and Me diterranean bluefin tuna (paragraph 10 of Recommendation by ICCAT replacing the Recommendation 24 -05 establishing a multi -annual management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 25 -04)). The allocation from the CPC’s nat ional quota to the pilot project should be specified in the annual fishing plan and should be on a limited scale and approved by Panel 2. This plan should also include details of the control measures that will be put in place to ensure that the activity is carried out in line with this Resolution, and the manner in which these rules will be made mandatory for operators. The fishing plan should be analysed, and, as appropriate, endorsed by Panel 2 intersessionally (Rec. 25-04, paragraph 11). 6. CPCs who wish to engage in the pilot project on short-term live storage of bluefin tuna should do so in accordance with this Resolution, including Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. 7. The pilot project will be assessed by the Commission no later than 2027 to determine whether and how the activity should continue beyond the pilot project stage. CPCs participating in the pilot project will submit a report on the results of the project for consideration by the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS). The report should, inter alia, clearly identify any difficulties in carrying out the pilot project, including if there are provisions of the appendices or relevant ICCAT Recommendations that cannot be implemented. 8. The CPCs that engaged in the pilot project shall report to the Commission on the implementation of this pilot by 1 November every year until the final report is due for assessment by the Commission. This report shall include information on the storage amount and the statistics on implementation and verification and control procedures and the outcomes of that process and data a bout these trade events, including relevant statistical information. 226 Appendix 1 Definitions 1. For purposes of the short-term live storage pilot project: a) “auxiliary vessel” means any vessel used to transport dead bluefin tuna (not processed) from a storage cage, a purse seine vessel to a designated port, and/or to a processing vessel. b) “eBCD” means an electronical bluefin catch document. c) “caging” means the relocation of live bluefin tuna from the transport cage to the storage cage. d) “catching vessel” means a vessel used for the purposes of the commercial capture of bluefin tuna resources. e) “control camera” means a stereoscopic camera and/or conventional video camera for the purpose of the controls foreseen in this Resolution. f) “harvesting” means the killing of bluefin tuna in a storage cage. g) “fishing vessel” means any powered vessel used for the purposes of the commercial exploitation of bluefin tuna resources, including catching vessels, fish processing vessels, support vessels, towing vessels, vessels engaged in transshipment, and transport vessels equipped for the transportation of tuna products and auxiliary vessels, except container vessels. h) “short-term live storage” means keeping bluefin tuna in a storage cage up to a maximum of three months, without fattening them or increasing their total biomass. i) “stereoscopic camera” means a camera with two or more lenses, with a separate image sensor or film frame for each lens, enabling the taking of three -dimensional images for the purpose of measuring the length of the fish and assisting in refining the number and weight of bluefin tuna. j) “storage cage” means cages that are used for the short -term live storage of bluefin tuna. k) “transport cage” means cages that are used for the transport of live tuna to the storage cage. l) “transfer operations” means: a) any transfer of live bluefin tuna from the catching vessel's net to the transport cage; b) any transfer of live bluefin tuna from the transport cage to a storage cage; c) any transfer of live bluefin tuna from a storage cage to a transport cage. Authorization 2. Any CPC that takes part in the pilot project for the short-term live storage, will designate a competent authority, hereafter referred to as the “CPC competent authority”, that will be responsible for coordinating the collection and verification of informa tion for the control of transfers, caging, harvesting and related transports of bluefin tuna conducted under its jurisdiction. 3. Before the start of a transfer operation, caging or harvesting, the master of the catching vessel or its representative, or the representative of the storage cage, will send a prior notification to the CPC competent authority indicating the following, as applicable, depending on the operation: - the number of individuals and the estimated weight of the bluefin tuna in kg; - the name of the catching vessel or storage cage, with their respective ICCAT record number; - the date and the location of the catch, caging or harvesting; - the date and the estimated time of transfer, caging or harvesting; - the eBCD number concerned, as confirmed and validated by the CPC competent authority; 227 - details of auxiliary vessels involved in the operation; - estimated quantities to be transferred, caged or harvested in number of individuals and kg. 4. A transfer, caging or harvesting operation will not be authorized by the CPC competent authority if, on receipt of the prior notification, it considers that: - the catching vessel does not have a valid authorization to fish for bluefin tuna; - the number and weight of fish have not been duly reported by the master of the catching vessel or its representative, or the representative of the storage cage; - the catching vessel that has caught the fish does not have sufficient quota; - the storage cage of destination is not reported as active; - the fish to be caged have not been duly reported by the catching vessel, and have not been taken into account for the calculation of any quota uptake that may be applicable; - the ICCAT regional observer is not present and no derogation is applicable; - relevant activities have not been appropriately recorded in the eBCD system. Unique numbers and catching vessels assigned to the cages 5. All cages used in transfer, caging and harvesting operations and associated transports will be numbered in accordance with the unique numbering system referred to in the multi -annual conservation and management plan for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean b luefin tuna (Rec. 25-04, paragraphs 147-150). 6. To facilitate traceability, a storage cage will only contain bluefin tuna from one catching vessel. The CPC competent authority may authorize a vessel to utilize an empty cage which has previously been used by a different vessel. Control measures 7. Before the start of a transfer operation, caging or harvesting, the master of the catching vessel or its representative, or the representative of the storage cage, will report their activities in their electronic fishing logbook and forward the information to the CPC competent authority on a daily basis. 8. All transfer and caging operations will be monitored by control camera in the water, in accordance with the minimum standards and procedures set out in Appendix 2 , to determine the number of individuals of bluefin tuna. All caging operations should be recorded using both conventional and stereoscopic cameras in the water, and all video footage should comply with the minimum standards set out in Appendix 2. 9. A copy of the relevant video records will be provided to the regional observer and to the CPC competent authority immediately. Copies of the video records should be provided by the CPC competent authority to the SCRS upon request. The SCRS should keep the confidentiality of commercial activities. 10. The CPC competent authority will determine the number and weight of the bluefin tuna being caged by analyzing the video footage of each caging operation. To carry out this analysis, the authorities will follow the relevant standards and procedures for stereoscopic camera systems set out in the applicable annexes, including Annex 9, of Rec. 25-04. 11. The CPC will ensure 100% observer coverage from the ICCAT Regional Observer Programme referred to in Rec. 25-04) (and any successor recommendations) during all catching, transfer, caging and harvesting operations. 12. Notwithstanding the above, when, for reasons of force majeure (e.g., pandemic) duly notified to ICCAT, the deployment of a regional observer is not possible, the vessel or storage cage may operate without the observer. In such cases, CPCs will prioritize s uch vessels and storage cages for control and inspection. In addition, CPCs will implement a set of appropriate alternative measures aimed at achieving the objectives of the regional observer programme, including, where possible, deploying either a nationa l inspector or a national observer to act in locum of the regional observer. The CPC concerned will send all details of the alternative measures to the Secretariat. The Secretariat will 228 compile and circulate all the information received on the implementation of these procedures to the Commission. Such alternative measures and the actions taken will be examined by the Compliance Committee during each Annual Meeting. 13. By way of derogation from paragraph 11 harvesting from each storage cage up to 1000 kg per day and up to a maximum of 50 t per storage cage per year to supply the fresh bluefin tuna market, may be authorized by the relevant CPC provided that an authorized inspector from the storage cage CPC is onsite for 100% of such harvests, and controls the entire operation. The authorized inspector will also validate the harvested quantities in the eBCD system. In this case, the regional observer’s signature is not required in the harvest section of the eBCD. If the bluefin tuna has been tagged, a storage cage can contain bluefin tuna from more than one catching vessel. 14. At arrival of the transport cage in the vicinity of the storage cage, the storage cage CPC competent authority will ensure that: a) if a regional observer is not onboard the catching vessel concerned, the vessel should maintain at a distance of minimum 1 nautical mile from any facility until the storage cage CPC competent authority is physically present; and b) the position and activity of the relevant towing vessel is monitored at all times. c) No caging operation will start: - before it has been duly authorized by the storage cage CPC competent authority; - without the presence of the storage cage CPC competent authority and the ICCAT regional observer; - before the catch and live trade sections of the eBCD have been completed and validated by the catching flag or storage cage CPC competent authority(ies). 15. After transfer of the bluefin tuna from the towing cage to the storage cage, the storage cage CPC control authority will ensure that storage cages containing bluefin tuna are sealed at all times following the sealing operations procedure contained in Annex 14 of Rec. 25-04. Unsealing will only be possible in the presence of the storage cage CPC competent authority and following its authorization. The storage cage CPC control authority should establish protocols for the sealing of storage cages, ensuring the use of official seals and that these seals are placed in such a way that they prevent the opening of doors without the seals being broken. 16. The short-term live storage CPC competent authority will carry out random controls in storage cages under their jurisdiction (Rec. 25-04, paragraphs 211-218). The CPC will describe the measures for random controls in their annual fishing plan (Rec. 25-04, paragraph 12). 17. Each transfer, caging and harvesting operation will be recorded in the eBCD system to ensure appropriate traceability. 18. Notwithstanding the above, all vessels used to transport live bluefin tuna will, irrespective of their length, install and operate a VMS, in accordance with Recommendation by ICCAT concerning minimum standards for vessel monitoring systems in the ICCAT Convention area (Rec. 18 -10), and transmit messages at least once every hour. Dead and dying fish 19. During transfer and caging operations, and during the period the bluefin tuna is stored in the storage cages, sick, injured, dead and dying fish will be removed and those not yet dead will be killed. These fish will be entered into the eBCD system and may be traded. 229 Enforcement 20. CPCs will take appropriate enforcement measures with respect to the master of the catching vessel or its representative, or the representative of the storage cage, where it has been established, in accordance with its law, that the fishing vessel or storage cage flying its flag does not comply with the provisions of this appendix. 21. The measures will be commensurate with the gravity of the offence and in accordance with the pertinent provisions of national law in such a way as to make sure that they effectively deprive those responsible of the economic benefit derived from their infringement without prejudice to the exercise of their profession. Those sanctions will also be capable of producing results proportionate to the seriousness of such infringement, thereby effectively discouraging further offences of the same kind. 230 Appendix 2 Minimum standards for video recording procedures applicable to transfer, caging and/or release operations 1. Each storage cage CPC concerned should ensure that the following procedures apply to all video recordings of transfer, caging and/or release operations referred to in this Resolution: a) At the beginning and/or the end of each video, where requested, the ICCAT transfer or caging authorization number or release order should be displayed; b) The time and the date of the video should be continuously displayed throughout each video record; c) The video record should be continuous without any interruptions and cuts, and cover the entire transfer, caging and/or release operation; d) Before the start of the transfer, caging and/or release operation, the video record should include the opening and closing of the net/door and, for transfers and caging operations, show whether the receiving and donor cage(s) already contain bluefin tuna; e) The video record should be of sufficient quality to determine the number and, where appropriate the weight, of bluefin tuna being transferred, caged and/or released; f) The original video record should be kept on board the donor vessel, or by the storage cage operator where appropriate, during their entire period of authorization to operate; g) The electronic storage device containing the original video record should be immediately provided to the ICCAT regional and/or CPC national observer after the end of the transfer, caging and/or release operation. The ICCAT regional observer and/or CPC observer should immediately initialize it to avoid any further manipulation. 2. Each flag and storage cage CPC concerned should establish the necessary measures to avoid any replacement, edition or manipulation of the original video records. 231 16-11 BIL RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON MANAGEMENT MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC SAILFISH (Entry into force 12 June 2017) CONSIDERING that in light of the results of the stock assessment of the Atlantic sailfish ( Istiophorus albicans) unde rtaken in 2016 and in order to manage this species in a precautionary manner an annual catch limit should be established for the western and eastern stocks of Atlantic sailfish consistent with the scientific advice; RECALLING the provisions of the Recommendation by ICCAT on the Principles of Decision Making for ICCAT Conservation and Management Measures (Rec. 11-13); NOTING that the western and eastern Atlantic stocks of sailfish are caught in a variety of ICCAT fisheries (e.g. longline, purse seine, recreational, and artisanal surface fisheries); RECOGNIZING that SCRS has highlighted that recent research has demonstrated that in some longline fisheries the use of circle hooks resulted in a reduction of billfish mortality, while the catch rates of several of the target species remained the same or were greater than the catch rates observed with conventional J hooks; ACKNOWLEDGING that catches of sailfish are likely under-reported, and according to the SCRS, this is one of the main sources of uncertainty in the assessment; RECOGNISING the importance of the ICCAT Enhanced Research Programme for Billfish and the need to improve catch data reporting for sailfish; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) whose vessels catch Atlantic sailfish (Istiophorus albicans ) in the Convention Area shall ensure that management measures are in place to support the conservation of this species in line with ICCAT's Convention objective by undertaking the following: (a) If the total catch of either stock of Atlantic sailfish exceeds in any year the level corresponding to 67 % of the average estimate of their Maximum Sustainable Yield (i.e. 1,271 t for the eastern stock and 1,030 t for the western stock ), the Commission shall review the implementation and effectiveness of this recommendation. (b) To prevent catches from exceeding this level for either stock of sailfish, CPCs shall take or maintain appropriate measures to limit sailfish mortality. Such measures could include, for example: releasing live sailfish, encouraging or requiring the use of ci rcle hooks or other effective gear modifications, implementing a minimum size, and/or limiting days at sea. 2. CPCs shall enhance their efforts to collect data on catches of sailfish, including live and dead discards, and report these data annually as part of their Task I and II data submission to support the stock assessment process. The SCRS shall review these data and determine the feasibility of estimating fishing mortality by commercial fisheries (including longline, gillnets and purse seine), recreational fisheries and artisanal fisheries. 3. The SCRS shall also develop a new data collection initiative as part of the ICCAT Enhanced Program for Billfish Research to overcome the data gap issues of those fisheries, in particular artisanal fisheries of developing CPCs, and shall recommend the initiative to the Commission for its approval in 2017. 4. In their Annual Reports, beginning in 2017, CPCs shall describe their data collection programmes and steps taken to implement this Recommendation. 5. This recommendation shall be reviewed in light of the outcomes of the next stock assessment for Atlantic sailfish. 232 18-05 BIL RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON IMPROVEMENT OF COMPLIANCE REVIEW OF CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES REGARDING BILLFISH CAUGHT IN THE ICCAT CONVENTION AREA (Entry into force 21 June 2019) RECALLING that pursuant to Recommendation by ICCAT to Replace Rec. 15 -05 to Further Strengthen the Plan to Rebuild Blue Marlin and White Marlin Stocks (Rec. 18 -04F 1) and Recommendation by ICCAT on Management Measures for the Conservation of Atlantic Sailfish (Rec. 16-11), CPCs are required to report through their Annual Reports on their implementation of the requirements of these measures; FURTHER RECALLING that the Report of the Second Independent Performance Review recommended that the Commission prioritize the issue of poor reporting on the blue and white marlin stocks, and that the Compliance Committee at its 2017 meeting recommended that in order to improve compliance in the billfish fisheries, a reporting check sheet be developed for consideration for adoption at the 2018 Annual meeting; RECOGNIZING the need to improve the means to facilitate the review process of implementation of and compliance with billfish conservation and management measures, while reducing the reporting burden on CPCs; DESIRING to streamline ICCAT reporting requirements, including by eliminating redundancies. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. All CPCs shall submit to the ICCAT Secretariat, with their Annual Reports, details of their implementation of and compliance with billfish conservation and management measures using the check sheet in Annex 1, as may be revised by the ICCAT Secretariat in consultation with the COC and PA4 Chairs to reflect new billfish measures adopted by the Commission. 2. If there are no changes from the previous year in a CPC’s implementation of ICCAT billfish measures covered by the check sheet in Annex 1 and no additional reporting fields have been included to reflect new billfish measures, the CPC shall not be required to submit a billfish check sheet, provided that it confirms in its Annual Report that there are no changes. If there are changes from the previous year in a CPC’s implementation, or additional reporting fields have been included in the billfish check sheet to reflect new billfish measures, the CPC shall only be required to submit such updates or responses to new reporting fields with their Annual Reports. However, CPCs shall submit updated billfish check sheets in full in the years when the Compliance Committee is scheduled to prioritize review of the billfish check sheets in accordance with paragraph 4. 3. CPCs may be exempt from the submission of the check sheet when vessels flying their flag are not likely to catch any billfish species covered by the Recommendations covered by the check sheet, on the condition that the concerned CPCs obtained a confirmatio n by the Billfish Species Group through necessary data submitted by CPCs for this purpose. 4. The Compliance Committee meeting shall prioritize review of CPC billfish check sheets at its 2020 Annual meeting. Future review will occur on an ICCAT meeting cycle as determined by the Committee, without prejudice to the competency of the Committee to co nsider billfish measure implementation issues at annual meetings during other years as appropriate. 1 This measure was repealed and replaced by Recommendation 19-05. 233 Annex 1 Billfish Check Sheet Name of CPC:______________________________________________ Note: Each ICCAT requirement must be implemented in a legally binding manner.

Tomé & Príncipe 20 Trinidad and Tobago 15 Venezuela 50 TOTAL 355 The United States shall limit its landings to 250 recreationally caught Atlantic blue marlin and white marlin/roundscale spearfish combined on an annual basis. All other CPCs shall limit their landings to a maximum of 10 t of Atlantic blue marlin and 2 t of white marlin/roundscale spearfish combined. 3. a) Any excess of the annual landings limits established in paragraph 2 shall be deducted from the respective landings limits during or before the adjustment year, in the following way: Catch Year Adjustment Year 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 1 The following transfer of annual landings limit shall be authorized for blue marlin: From EU to Trinidad & Tobago: 2 t. 240 b) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) above, if any CPC exceeds its landings limit during any two consecutive years, its landings limit shall be reduced on or before the adjustment year by at least 125% of the excess harvest, and the Commission may recommend ad ditional actions, as appropriate. c) Starting with 2020 catches, any underharvest by a CPC of its annual landings limit may not be carried forward to a subsequent year. Live release requirement and retention allowances 4. To the extent possible, CPCs shall require pelagic longline vessels and purse seine vessels flying their flag to promptly release blue marlin and white marlin/roundscale spearfish that are alive at haul-back, giving due consideration to the safety of crew members, in a manner that causes the least harm and maximizes post-release survival. 5. CPCs shall encourage the implementation of the minimum standards for safe handling and live release procedures, as specified in Annex 1 while giving due consideration to the safety of the crew. The fishing vessels should have readily available on deck and easily accessible by crew, a lifting device, bolt cutter, dehooker/disgorger and line-cutter for safe release of live marlins caught. 6. CPCs should ensure that captain and crew members of their fishing vessels are adequately trained, aware of and use proper mitigation, identification, handling and releasing techniques and keep on board all equipment necessary for the release of marlins in accordance with the minimum standards for safe handling procedures as specified in Annex 1. Nothing in this measure shall prevent CPCs from adopting more stringent measures. 7. CPCs shall endeavor to minimize the post -release mortality of marlins/roundscale spearfish in their ICCAT fisheries. 8. CPCs may authorize their pelagic longline and purse seine vessels to catch and retain on board, transship, or land blue marlin and white marlin/roundscale spearfish that are dead , within their landing limit. 9. For CPCs that prohibit dead discards, the landings of blue marlin and white marlin/roundscale spearfish that are dead when brought alongside the vessel and that are not sold or entered into commerce shall not count against the limits established in paragra ph 2, on the condition that such prohibition be clearly explained in their Annual Report. This provision shall be applicable only to commercial fisheries. 10. Blue marlin and white marlin/roundscale spearfish that are caught for local consumption by developing coastal CPCs, or by other CPCs' small island, artisanal, subsistence, and small-scale coastal fisheries are exempted from Paragraph 4 provided these CPCs (a) submit Task I and Task II data according to the reporting procedures established by the SCRS and (b) in the case of non-developing coastal CPCs, notify the Commission of their claim to this exemption and measures taken to limit application of this exemption to such fisheries. 11. For recreational and sport fisheries: a) CPCs shall take appropriate measures to ensure that any released fish are released in a manner that causes the least harm. b) CPCs shall establish minimum sizes for retention that meet or exceed the following lengths: 251 cm Lower Jaw -Fork Length (LJFL) for blue marlin and 168 cm LJFL for white marlin/roundscale spearfish. c) CPCs shall prohibit the sale, or offering for sale, of any part or whole carcass of blue marlin or white marlin/roundscale spearfish caught in recreational and sport fisheries. 241 Observer programme 12. CPCs shall collect catch data on blue marlin and white marlin/roundscale spearfish, including live and dead discards, through logbooks and scientific observer programs as required by Rec. 11 -10 and Rec. 16-14. CPCs shall include their estimates of total de ad and live discards in their Task I Nominal Catch data submission. 13. CPCs shall establish or maintain data collection programs in recreational and sport fisheries, including a minimum of 5% scientific observer coverage of blue marlin and white marlin/roundscale spearfish tournaments, to ensure that catches are reported in a ccordance with existing ICCAT reporting obligations. Data collection and reporting 14. CPCs shall provide their estimates of total live and dead discards of blue marlin , white marlin/roundscale spearfish, based on fishing logbooks, landing declarations, or equivalent document for the sport/recreational fisheries, as well as scientific observer reports, as part of their Task I and II data submission to support the stock assessment process. 15. Starting with the reporting of 2020 catches, failure to report Task I data, including dead discards, for blue marlin and white marlin/roundscale spearfish in accordance with established ICCAT requirements will result in a prohibition of retention of these species in accordance with the Recommendation by ICCAT on Penalties Applicable in Case of Non Fulfilment of Reporting Obligations (Rec. 11-15). 16. No later than 2020, CPCs shall present to the SCRS the statistical methodology used to estimate dead and live discards. CPCs with artisanal and small -scale fisheries shall also provide information about their data collection programs. The SCRS shall review these methodologies and if it determines that a methodology is not scientifically sound, the SCRS shall provide relevant feedback to the CPCs in question to improve the methodologies. The SCRS shall also determine if one or more capacity building workshops are warranted to help CPCs to comply with the requirement to report total live and dead discards. If so, the Secretariat in coordination with the SCRS should begin organizing the SCRS -recommended workshop(s) in 2021 with a view to convening them as soon as practicable. 17. The SCRS shall evaluate the completeness of Task 1 and 2 data submissions, including estimates of total dead and live discards, and determine the feasibility of estimating fishing mortalities by industrial fisheries (including longline and purse seine), artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries. If after conducting such evaluation, the SCRS determines that significant gaps in data reporting exist, the SCRS should explore approaches to estimate the level of unreported catches to include in future stock assessments in order to enhance the basis on which to provide management advice to the Commission. SCRS work and request for scientific advice 18. The SCRS shall continue its work to further improve data collection initiatives as part of the ICCAT Enhanced Program for Billfish Research to overcome the data gap issues of those fisheries, in particular artisanal fisheries of developing CPCs to inform future decisions by the Commission. 19. The Secretariat, with support from the Commission and the SCRS, shall continue its review of the relevant work conducted by the regional and sub -regional international organizations, similar to the review conducted for West Africa, with a priority focus on the Caribbean and Latin America. The Secretariat and CPCs are also encouraged to collaborate with the Western Central Atlantic Fisheries Commission (WECAFC) on fishery statistics on ICCAT species. Taking into account the findings of these regional reviews, the CPCs shall take action, as appropriate, to improve data collection and reporting programs in accordance with any SCRS advice in preparation for the next white marlin/roundscale spearfish and blue marlin stock assessments. 242 20. The Permanent Working Group for the Improvement of ICCAT Statistics and Conservation Measures (PWG), in cooperation with the SCRS, shall work to develop recommendations on the following issues for consideration at the 2021 annual meeting of the Commission: a) Minimum standard for an electronic monitoring system such as: (i) the minimum specification of the recording equipment (e.g. resolution. recording time capacity, data storage type, data protection) (ii) the number of cameras to be installed at which points on board b) What shall be recorded c) Data analysis standards, e.g., converting video footage into actionable data by the use of artificial intelligence d) Data to be analyzed, e.g., species, length, estimated weight, fishing operation details e) Reporting format to the Secretariat In 2020 CPCs are encouraged to conduct trials on electronic monitoring and report the results back to the PWG and the SCRS in 2021 for their review. 21. The SCRS shall, in collaboration with CPCs, explore potential technical changes to the terminal gear (such as hook shape, hook size, leader type, etc.) and fishing practices (e.g., timing, soaking time, bait, depths, areas) that could reduce bycatch and bycatch mortality (at-vessel and post-release). As part of this process, the SCRS in collaboration with CPCs shall design and implement a study(ies) to compare the effects of hook shape and size on catch rates (considering both hooking and retention rates), at- haulback mortality, and post -release mortality. The experimental design should account for the influence of leader material types and consider potential operational differences among regions and fleets. 22. The SCRS shall conduct assessments for blue marlin in 2024 and white marlin/roundscale spearfish in 2025. Compliance 23. Consistent with the Recommendation by ICCAT on Improvement of Compliance Review of Conservation and Management Measures Regarding Billfish Caught in the ICCAT Convention Area (Rec. 18-05), CPCs shall submit details of their implementation of this measure through domestic law or regulations, including monitoring, control and surveillance measures, and of their compliance with this measure using the billfish check sheet. Repeals and review clause 24. In 2022, the Commission shall review any new scientific advice from the SCRS and consider adjustments, such as the adoption of additional conservation and management measures or review of the landing limits, as appropriate. 25. This Recommendation repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT to Replace Rec. 15-05 to Further Strengthen the Plan to Rebuild Blue Marlin and White Marlin Stocks (Rec. 18-04). 243 Annex 1 Minimum standards for safe handling and live release procedures42F 2 The following steps should be followed to reduce stress and injury to incidentally caught marlins and round scale spearfish specimens for a maximum probability of survival while minimizing the safety risk to the crew. Skippers and crew should always put th eir personal safety first when releasing marlins and other large fish. Wear gloves and avoid working around the spear -shaped bill. These basic guidelines do not replace stricter safety rules established by CPCs national Authorities. ­ Stop the vessel or substantially reduce its speed. ­ Secure the far side of the longline mainline to the boat to avoid that any remaining gear in the water pulls on the line and the animal. ­ Bring the marlin as close to the vessel as possible without putting too much tension on the branchline to avoid that a released hook or branchline breaks could shoot hook, weights and other parts toward the vessels at high speed. ­ Do not remove the alive marlin from the water boatside, while safely removing the hook. ­ Limit the number of manipulation. ­ Do not gaff the fish in the body. ­ If possible, avoid grabbing the marlin by the body and use gloves to grab the marlin by its snout or a snooter. ­ In case the hook is visible, lightly flicking the branchline to try dislodging the hook. ­ Where feasible rig a measuring device so the fish can be roughly measured in the water (e.g. mark a pole, leader and float; mark the gunwale of the boat with measurements marks). ­ If the marlin is vigorously twisting and spinning making it too dangerous to use a dehooker/disgorger or the marlin swallowed the hook that cannot be seen, then use a long - handled line cutter and cut the leader/line as close to the fish as safely possible so that they are not trailing large amounts of line that could reduce post-release survival. ­ Help revive the fish by slowly towing it in the water until its colour or energy returns (5 minutes or more). Most highly migratory species must keep water flowing over their gills to breathe. With the boat in gear, slowly move forward while keeping the fish’s head in the water. ­ If hooked, and hook is visible in the body or mouth, use a bolt cutter to remove the hook barb, and then remove the hook. ­ Don’t wrap your fingers, hands or arms in the line when bringing a marlin to the boat – you might get pulled overboard. ­ Don’t lift them using the branchline, especially if hooked. ­ Do not lift using thin wires or cables or by the tail alone. 2 https://www.bmis-bycatch.org/index.php/mitigation-techniques/safe-handling-release ­ Poisson F., Wendling B., Cornella D., Segorb C., 2016.

Until such time as sustainable levels of harvest can be determined through peer reviewed stock assessments by SCRS or other organizations, CPCs shall take appropriate measures to reduce fishing mortality in fisheries targeting porbeagle ( Lamna nasus ) and North Atlantic shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus). 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, CPCs may conduct scientifically based research that is submitted to SCRS for these species in the Convention area. 4. CPCs shall, where possible, implement research on pelagic shark species caught in the Convention area in order to identify potential nursery areas. Based on this research, CPCs shall consider time and area closures and other measures, as appropriate. 5. The SCRS shall, as soon as possible but no later than 2009, conduct a stock assessment or a thorough review of available stock assessment information of, and recommend management advice for, porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus). 249 09-07 BYC RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON THE CONSERVATION OF THRESHER SHARKS CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH FISHERIES IN THE ICCAT CONVENTION AREA (Entry into force: June 1, 2010) RECALLING that the Commission adopted the Resolution by ICCAT on Atlantic Sharks [Res. 01-11], the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Conservation of Sharks Caught in Association with Fisheries Managed by ICCAT [Rec. 04-10], the Recommendation by ICCAT to Amend the Recommendation 04-10 on the Conservation of Sharks Caught in Association with the Fisheries Managed by ICCAT [Rec. 05 -05], the Supplemental Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning Sharks [Rec. 07-06] and the Recommendation by ICCAT on the Conservation of Bigeye Thresher Sharks (Alopias su perciliosus) Caught in Association with Fisheries Managed by ICCAT [Rec. 08-07], CONSIDERING that thresher sharks of the family Alopiidae are caught as by -catch in the ICCAT Convention area, NOTING that at its 2009 Meeting the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) recommended that the Commission prohibit retention and landings of bigeye thresher shark ( Alopias superciliosus), RECALLING the need to annually report Task I and Task II for catches of sharks in conformity with the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Conservation of Sharks Caught in Association with Fisheries Managed by ICCAT [Rec. 04-10], THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNA (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties, and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereafter referred to as CPCs) shall prohibit, retaining onboard, transshipping, landing, storing, selling, or offering for sale any part or whole carcass of bigey e thresher sharks ( Alopias superciliosus) in any fishery with exception of a Mexican small-scale coastal fishery with a catch of less than 110 fish. 2. CPCs shall require vessels flying their flag to promptly release unharmed, to the extent practicable, bigeye thresher sharks when brought along side for taking on board the vessel. 3. CPCs should strongly endeavor to ensure that vessels flying their flag do not undertake a directed fishery for species of thresher sharks of the genus Alopias spp. 4. CPCs shall require the collection and submission of Task I and Task II data for Alopias spp other than A. superciliosus in accordance with ICCAT data reporting requirements. The number of discards and releases of A. superciliosus must be recorded with indication of status (dead or alive) and reported to ICCAT in accordance with ICCAT data reporting requirements. 5. CPCs shall, where possible, implement research on thresher sharks of the species Alopias spp in the Convention area in order to identify potential nursery areas. Based on this research, CPCs shall consider time and area closures and other measures, as appropriate. 6. Recommendation by ICCAT on the Conservation of Bigeye Thresher Sharks (Alopias superciliosus) Caught in Association with Fisheries Managed by ICCAT [Rec. 08-07] is superseded by this Recommendation. 250 (Entry into force: June 14, 2011) CONSIDERING that oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) are caught as by-catch in the ICCAT Convention area, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that (a) the oceanic whitetip shark has been ranked as one of the five species with the highest degree of risk in an ecological risk assessment; (b) it has high at -vessel survival and constitutes a small portion of the shark catch; (c) it is one of the ea siest shark species to identify; and (d) that a significant proportion of the species catch is composed of juveniles, FURTHER CONSIDERING that SCRS recommends adoption of a minimum size of 200 cm total length to protect juveniles, RECOGNIZING that such minimum size regulation may cause enforcement difficulties, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNA (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties, and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereafter referred to as CPCs) shall prohibit retaining onboard, transshipping, landing, storing , selling, or offering for sale any part or whole carcass of oceanic whitetip sharks in any fishery. 2. CPCs shall record through their observer programs the number of discards an d releases of oceanic whitetip sharks with indication of status (dead or alive) and report it to ICCAT. 10-07 SHK RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON THE CONSERVATION OF OCEANIC WHITETIP SHARK CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH FISHERIES IN THE ICCAT CONVENTION AREA 251 (Entry into force: 14 June 2011) RECALLING that the Commission adopted the Resolution by ICCAT on Atlantic Sharks [Res. 01-11], the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Conservation of Sharks caught in Association with Fisheries Managed by ICCAT [Rec. 04-10], the Recommendation by ICCAT to Amend the Recommendation 04-10 on the Conservation of Sharks Caught in Association with the Fisheries Managed of ICCAT [Rec. 05 -05F 1] and the Supplemental Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning Sharks [Rec. 07-06]. NOTING that Sphyrna lewini and Sphyrna zygaena are among the shark species for which there are sustainability concerns. CONSIDERING that it is difficult to differentiate between the various species of hammerhead sharks except for the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) without taking them on board and that such action might jeopardize the survival of the captured individuals. RECALLING the need to annually report Task I and Task II for catches of sharks in conformity with the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Conservation of Sharks Caught in Association with Fisheries Managed by ICCAT [Rec. 04-10]; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties, and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereafter referred to as CPCs) shall prohibit retaining onboard, transshipping, landing, storing, selling, or offering for sale any part or whole carcass of hammerh ead sharks of the family Sphyrnidae (except for the Sphyrna tiburo), taken in the Convention area in association with ICCAT fisheries. 2. CPCs shall require vessels flying their flag, to promptly release unharmed, to the extent practicable, hammerhead sharks when brought alongside the vessel. 3. Hammerhead sharks that are caught by developing coastal CPCs for local consumption are exempted from the measures established in paragraphs 1 and 2, provided these CPCs submit Task I and, if possible, Task II data according to the reporting procedures established by the SCRS. If it is not possible to provide catch data by species, they shall be provided at least by genus Sphryna. Developing coastal CPCs exempted from this prohibition pursuant to this paragraph should endeavor not to increase their catches of hammerhead sharks. Such CPCs shall take necessary measures to ensure that hammerhead sharks of the family Sphyrnidae (except of Sphyrna tiburo) will not enter international trade and shall notify the Commission of such measures. 4. CPCs shall require that the number of discards and releases of hammerhead sharks are recorded with indication of status (dead or alive) and reported to ICCAT in accordance with ICCAT data reporting requirements. 5. CPCs shall, where possible, implement research on hammerhead sharks in the Convention area in order to identify potential nursery areas. Based on this research, CPCs shall consider time and area closures and other measures, as appropriate. 5. As appropriate, the Commission and its CPCs should, individually and collectively, engage in capacity building efforts and other cooperative activities to support the effective implementation of this Recommendation, including entering into cooperative arra ngements with other appropriate international bodies. 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 14-06, 21-09 and 22-11. 10-08 SHK RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON HAMMERHEAD SHARKS (FAMILY SPHYRNIDAE) CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH FISHERIES MANAGED BY ICCAT 252 11-08 SHK RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON THE CONSERVATION OF SILKY SHARKS CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force: June 7, 2012) CONSIDERING that silky sharks ( Carcharhinus falciformis ) are caught in association with ICCAT fisheries; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that the silky shark has been ranked as the species with the highest degree of vulnerability in the 2010 ecological risk assessment for Atlantic sharks; CONSIDERING that SCRS recommends that proper conservation and management measures, similar to those adopted for other vulnerable shark species, be also adopted for the silky shark; NOTING the geographic range of the silky shark which inhabits coastal and oceanic waters throughout the tropics; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNA (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties, and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereafter referred to as CPCs) shall require fishing vessels flying their flag and operating in ICCAT managed fisheries to release all silky sharks whether dead or alive, and prohibit retaining on board, transshipping, or landing any part or whole carcass of silky shark. 2. CPCs shall require vessels flying their flag to promptly release silky sharks unharmed, at the latest before putting the catch into the fish holds, giving due consideration to the safety of crew members. Purse seine vessels engaged in ICCAT fisheries shal l endeavor to take additional measures to increase the survival rate of silky sharks incidentally caught. 3. CPCs shall record through their observer programs the number of discards and releases of silky sharks with indication of status (dead or alive) and report it to ICCAT. 4. Silky sharks that are caught by developing coastal CPCs for local consumption are exempted from the measures established in paragraphs 1 and 2, provided these CPCs submit Task I and, if possible, Task II data according to the reporting procedures established by the SCRS. CPCs that have not reported species- specific shark data shall provide a plan by July 1, 2012, for improving their data collection for sharks on a species specific level for review by the SCRS and Commission. Developing coastal CPCs exempted from the prohibition pursuant to this paragraph shall not increase their catches of silky sharks. Such CPCs shall take necessary measures to ensure that silky sharks will not enter international trade and shall notify the Commission of such measures. 5. Any CPC that does not report Task I data for silky shark, in accordance with SCRS data reporting requirements, shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph 1 until such data have been reported. 6. The prohibition on retention in paragraph 1 does not apply to CPCs whose domestic law requires that all dead fish be landed, that the fishermen cannot draw any commercial profit from such fish and that includes a prohibition against silky shark fisheries. 7. In their annual reports, CPCs shall inform the Commission of steps taken to implement this Recommendation through domestic law or regulations, including monitoring, control and surveillance measures that support implementation of this recommendation. 8. In 2012, the SCRS Sub -Committee on Statistics shall evaluate the data collection improvement plans (referenced in paragraph 4) submitted by CPCs and, as necessary, make recommendations on how shark data collection can be improved. 9. In 2013, the SCRS shall evaluate the information provided under paragraphs 3 and 4 and report on the sources of silky shark mortality in ICCAT fisheries, including silky shark discard mortality rates, and provide an analysis and advice regarding the benef its of a range of specific silky shark management options. 10. This measure should be reviewed in 2013 in light of the advice provided by the SCRS in accordance with paragraph 9. 253 13-10 SHK RECOMMENDATION ON BIOLOGICAL SAMPLING OF PROHIBITED SHARK SPECIES BY SCIENTIFIC OBSERVERS (Entry into force: June 10, 2014) CONSIDERING that the SCRS recommended the adoption of measures to enable scientific observers to collect biological samples from the shark species for which retention is prohibited by ICCAT and which are dead at haulback, provided that such samples are for a research project notified to the SCRS. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION the shark research and data collection program developed by the Shark Working Group of the SCRS. NOTING that for all these species there is an important lack of biological knowledge, for which the SCRS strongly recommends that such samples be collected. FURTHER NOTING that, as recommended by the SCRS, to obtain approval of such research projects, the proposal should include a detailed document that describes the objective of the work, the number and type of sample that need to be collected and the time-area distribution of the sampling. ACKNOWLEDGING the importance of promoting coordination between SCRS scientists and improving collaboration on research related to shark biology, as prioritised by the SCRS shark research and data collection program. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. By derogation to ICCAT conservation measures providing for the prohibition of retaining on board certain shark species, the collection of biological samples during commercial fishing operations (e.g vertebrae, tissue, reproductive tracts, stomachs, skin samples, coil valves, jaws, whole fish or skeletons for taxonomic studies and fauna inventories) by scientific observers or individuals duly permitted by the CPC to collect biological samples is authorised under the following conditions: a) The biological samples are collected only from animals which are dead at the haulback. b) The biological samples are taken in the framework of a research project notified to the SCRS and developed taking into consideration the recommended research priorities of the SCRS Shark Group. The research project should include a detailed document that describes the objective of the work, the methodologies to be used, the number and type of samples to be collected, the time-area distribution of the sampling and a chronogram of the activities to be carried out. c) The biological samples must be kept on board until the port of landing or transhipment. d) The authorisation of the flag State CPC or, in the case of chartered vessels, of the chartering CPC and the flag State CPC, must accompany all such samples collected according to this Recommendation until the final port of landing. Such samples and other parts of the shark specimens sampled may not be marketed or sold. 2. An annual report of the results achieved by the research project should be presented to the Shark Species Group and the SCRS. The SCRS should review and assess this report and provide advice on follow up. 3. The sampling campaign can only start once the authorisation by the relevant State has been issued. 254 15-06 SHK RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON PORBEAGLE CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force 4 June 2016) RECALLING that the Commission adopted the Resolution by ICCAT on Atlantic Sharks [Res. 01-11], the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Conservation of Sharks caught in association with fisheries managed by ICCAT [Rec. 04-10], the Recommendation of ICCAT to amend the Recommendation 04-10 on the Conservation of Sharks caught in association with the fisheries managed by ICCAT [Rec. 05 -0547F 1], the Supplemental Recommendation by ICCAT concerning Sharks [Rec. 07-06], including the obligation of CPCs to annually report Task 1 & 2 data for sharks; the Resolution by ICCAT on Porbeagle Shark (Lamna nasus) [Res. 08-08], and the Recommendation by ICCAT on Compliance with Existing Management Measures on shark Conservation and Management [Rec. 12-058F 2]; FURTHER RECALLING that the Commission has adopted management measures for shark species considered vulnerable to overfishing and caught in association with fisheries managed by ICCAT, including Bigeye Thresher sharks ( Alopias superciliosus ) [Rec. 09 -07], oceanic whitetip sharks ( Carcharhinus longimanus) [Rec. 10 -07], hammerhead sharks (family Sphyrnidae) [Rec. 10 -08] and silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) [Rec. 11-08]; NOTING that in 2009, SCRS attempted an assessment of the four porbeagle stocks in the Atlantic Ocean (northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast) and concluded that data for southern hemisphere porbeagle stocks were too limited to provide a robust indication on the st atus of the stocks and allow definition of sustainable harvest levels, whereas recovery of the northern hemisphere stocks to BMSY under no fishing mortality could take from 15 to 34 years for the northeast Atlantic stock and from 20 to 60 years for the northwest Atlantic stock (depending on the stock and model considered); FURTHER NOTING that the 2008 and 2012 Ecological Risk Assessments undertaken by the SCRS concluded that porbeagle (Lamna nasus) was among the most vulnerable shark species which makes it more susceptible to overfishing even at low fishing mortality levels; CONSIDERING that the report of 2015 meeting of the Standing Committee for Research and Statistics (SCRS) estimates that the biomass of northwest Atlantic and northeast Atlantic porbeagle shark is depleted to well below BMSY, but recent fishing mortality is below FMSY; FURTHER NOTING that ICES advice for the North -East Atlantic stock in 2015 recommended on the basis of the precautionary approach that no fishing for porbeagle should be permitted and that landings of porbeagle should not be allowed; ACKNOWLEDGING that the North -East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted Recommendation [2015 -7] on Conservation and Management Measures for Porbeagle in the NEAFC Regulatory Area and agreed that no directed fishery for porbeagle shall be undertaken in the Regula tory Area until end 2015; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) has adopted Recommendation GFCM/36/2012/3 prohibiting to retain on board, transship, landing, transfer, storage, selling or displaying or offering for sale porbeagle specimens caught in the Mediterranean; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that in 2014, porbeagle shark was added to Appendix 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species; FURTHER NOTING that, according to SCRS advice precautionary management measures should be considered for shark stocks where there is the greatest biological vulnerability and conservation concern and for which there are few data and/or greater uncertainty in assessment results. 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 14-06, 21-09 and 22-11. 2 This measure was repealed and replaced by Recommendation 18-06. 255 ACKNOWLEDGING that the 2015 SCRS advice recommended that porbeagle shark retrieved alive should be released alive, and all catches be reported; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that the 2015 SCRS advice also recommended that porbeagle fishing mortality should be kept to levels in line with scientific advice and with catches not exceeding the current level. FURTHER NOTING the intention of the SCRS to undertake, in partnership with International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, a joint stock assessment of northwest and northeast Atlantic porbeagle shark in 2019; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties, and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereafter referred to as CPCs) shall require their vessels to promptly release unharmed, to the extent practicable, porbeagle sharks caught in association with ICCAT fisheries when brought alive alongside for taking on board the vessel. 2. CPCs shall ensure the collection of Task I and Task II data for porbeagle sharks and their submission in accordance with ICCAT data reporting requirements. Discards and releases of porbeagle sharks shall be recorded with indication of status (dead or alive) and reported to ICCAT in accordance with ICCAT data reporting requirements. 3. In the event that catches of porbeagle caught in association with ICCAT fisheries increase beyond 2014 levels, the Commission will consider additional measures. 4. CPCs are encouraged to implement the research recommendations of the joint 2009 ICCAT -ICES inter- sessional meeting. In particular, CPCs are encouraged to implement research and monitoring projects at regional (stock) level, in the Convention area, in order to close gaps on key biological data for porbeagle and identify areas of high abundance of important life-history stages (e.g. mating, pupping and nursery grounds). SCRS should continue joint work with ICES Working Group on Elasmobranch Fishes. 5. This recommendation shall be reviewed after the next stock assessment of porbeagle shark stocks that will be performed by the SCRS or in collaboration with other recognized scientific organizations, as appropriate. 256 18-06 SHK RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO REPLACE RECOMMENDATION 16-13 ON IMPROVEMENT OF COMPLIANCE REVIEW OF CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES REGARDING SHARKS CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force 21 June 2019) RECALLING that ICCAT has adopted several recommendations for sharks, either in a general or species- specific manner, in accordance with an ecosystem approach; FURTHER RECALLING Recommendation by ICCAT on Compliance with Existing Measures on Shark Conservation and Management (Rec. 12-05) and Recommendation by ICCAT on Improvement of Compliance Review of Conservation and Management Measures regarding Sharks Caught in Association with ICCAT Fisheries (Rec. 16-13), which required CPCs to report on their implementation of and compliance with the shark conservation and management measures; RECOGNIZING the need to improve the means to facilitate review process of implementation of and compliance with the shark conservation and management measures, while minimizing the reporting burden on CPCs; DESIRING to streamline ICCAT reporting requirements, including by eliminating redundancies ; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. All CPCs shall submit to the ICCAT Secretariat, with their Annual Reports, details of their implementation of and compliance with shark conservation and management measures using the check sheet in Annex 1, as may be revised by the ICCAT Secretariat in consultation with the COC and PA4 Chairs to reflect new shark measures adopted by the Commission. 2. If there are no changes from the previous year in a CPC’s implementation of ICCAT shark measures covered by the check sheet in Annex 1 and no additional reporting fields have been included to reflect new shark measures, the CPC shall not be required to submit a shark check sheet, provided that it affirms in its Annual Report that there are no changes. If there are changes from the previou s year in a CPC’s implementation, or the additional reporting fields have been included in the shark check sheet to reflect new shark measures, the CPC shall only be required to submit such updates regarding implementation or responses to new reporting fields with their Annual Reports. However, CPCs shall submit updated shark check sheets in full in the years when the Compliance Committee is scheduled to prioritize review of the shark check sheets in accordance with paragraph 4. 3. CPCs may be exempt from the submission of the check sheet when vessels flying their flag are not likely to catch any sharks species covered by the abovementioned Recommendations in paragraph 1, on the condition that the concerned CPCs obtained a confirmati on by the Shark Species Group through necessary data submitted by CPCs for this purpose. 4. The Compliance Committee meeting shall prioritize review of CPC shark check sheets on an ICCAT meeting cycle as determined by the Committee, without prejudice to the competency of the Committee to consider shark measure implementation issues at annual meetings during other years as appropriate. 5. This Recommendation repeals the Recommendation by ICCAT on Compliance with Existing Measures on Shark Conservation and Management (Rec. 12-05) and the Recommendation by ICCAT on Improvement of Compliance Review of Conservation and Management Measures regarding Sharks Caught in Association with ICCAT Fisheries (Rec. 16-13). 257 Annex 1 Shark Implementation Check Sheet Name of CPC: ____________________________ Note: Each ICCAT requirement must be implemented in a legally binding manner.

The Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as “CPCs”), shall implement a rebuilding programme for North Atlantic shortfin mako shark starting in 2022 to end overfishing immediately and gradually achieve biomass levels sufficient to support maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2070 with a probability of a range of between 60 and 70% at least. 2. Toward that end, the rules set out in this Recommendation shall be applied by CPCs with the aim to reduce total fishing mortality (the sum of any retention, dead discards, and post -release mortality of live discards), to maintain mortality at sustainable levels to rebuild the stock, and to establish a process to determine whether in any given year there is a possibility for retention. First step in rebuilding the stock and process to determine future permissible retention 3. CPCs shall implement a prohibition on retaining on board, transhipping and landing, whole or in part, North Atlantic shortfin mako caught in association with ICCAT fisheries in 2022 and 2023 as a first step in rebuilding the stock. 4. The total fishing mortality tonnage associated with the probability level established in paragraph 1 shall be based on the most recent Kobe II strategy matrix provided by the SCRS for North Atlantic shortfin mako (the probability of both F < F MSY and SSF49F 1> SSFMSY). Following every stock assessment, the SCRS shall update the Kobe II strategy matrix consistent with the objectives established by paragraph 1 for endorsement by the Commission. a) Consistent with the objectives established under paragraph 1 and the 2019 SCRS Kobe II strategy matrix the total fishing mortality for North Atlantic shortfin mako shall be no more than 250 tonnes until new SCRS advice is provided to the Commission. 5. Future permissible retention shall be pursuant to the following process: a) During 2022 and 2023 the SCRS and Panel 4 shall work together to test and confirm the appropriateness of the approach in Annex 1 , or alternative approaches, for determining the amount of permissible retention of North Atlantic shortfin mako in the future. Any alternative approaches shall take into consideration, among other factors, the relative contributions made by CPCs to conserve, manage, and rebuild the stock (including a CPC's performance in reducing its mortality in line with the objectives of previo us ICCAT Recommendations 17-08 and 19-06) and other criteria as set out in Resolution 15 -13, as well as the need to continue to incentivize individual CPC accountability to achieve fishing mortality reductions in line with the objectives of this rebuilding program. To assist with this work, the SCRS shall, as appropriate, provide to the Commission estimates of post release mortality and, where needed, estimates of dead discards, taking into account data submitted by CPCs and other relevant information and analyses. b) Notwithstanding paragraph 3, in 2022, the SCRS will use Annex 1 to calculate possible retention allowed in 2023 and provide the results to the Commission, which shall then validate the amount of any permissible retention in 2023. c) Starting in 2023 and annually thereafter, the SCRS will use Annex 1 , unless an alternative approach to calculating future permissible retention is agreed (as per paragraph 5(a)), to calculate a possible level of retention, including eligible CPCs’ individual retention allowances, allowed in the subsequent year, and provide the results to the Commission. 1 SSF is Spawning stock fecundity, which is used for Kobe II risk matrix for North Atlantic shortfin mako. 269 d) Starting in 2023 and annually thereafter, the Commission shall validate the amount of permissible retention in the subsequent year, based on advice from the SCRS in accordance with paragraph 5(c). 6. CPCs whose fishing vessels retain North Atlantic shortfin mako shall prohibit transshipping, whole or in part, North Atlantic shortfin mako caught in association with ICCAT fisheries. 7. Any retention permissible in accordance with paragraph 5 shall be allowed only when the fish is dead on haulback and the vessel has an observer or a functioning electronic monitoring system (EMS) on board to verify the condition of the sharks. a) For vessels of 12 meters or less, no more than one specimen of North Atlantic shortfin mako shall be retained by a vessel for any fishing trip. b) For the purposes of this paragraph, a fishing trip is defined as the time period that begins when a fishing vessel departs from a dock, berth, beach, seawall, ramp, or port to carry out fishing operations and that terminates with a return to a dock, berth, beach, seawall, ramp, or port. 8. Paragraphs 3 to 7 shall not apply to Iceland and Norway whose domestic law requires that any dead fish be landed, provided that: a) The fish is dead on haulback; b) Directed fishing for shortfin mako sharks is prohibited; c) The amount of landed North Atlantic shortfin mako is reported in the CPC’s Shark Implementation Check Sheet, as required by Recommendation 18-06 and any future successor or revision thereto; d) North Atlantic shortfin mako be landed with their fins naturally attached; and e) Fishermen are prohibited from drawing any commercial value from such fish. Safe handling and release 9. Upon entry into force of this Recommendation, CPCs shall require vessels flying their flag to implement, while giving due consideration to the safety of the cre w, the minimum standards for safe handling and release procedures of North Atlantic shortfin mako shark, as provided under Annex 2 of this Recommendati on, in order to promptly release unharmed, to the extent practicable, and to improve survivability of live North Atlantic shortfin mako shark when brought alongside the vessel. Revisions to Annex 2 may be considered by the Commission as new information from the SCRS becomes available. Requirements for reporting on implementation 10. In accordance with Rec. 18 -06, CPCs shall submit a Shark Implementation Check Sheet to provide information on how this Recommendation is being implemented. If the Compliance Committee determines that any CPC fails to report as required by Rec. 18 -06, that CPC shall immediately require its fishing vessels to refrain from retaining or landing North Atlantic shortfin mako sharks until the required reporting is made to ICCAT. 11. CPCs shall report to the ICCAT Secretariat, in accordance with ICCAT data reporting requirements, total catches, including any landings, dead discards and live releases, of North Atlantic shortfin mako . The frequency of reporting shall be month ly for any permissible landings in order to closely monitor the uptake of the retention allowance, and annually for dead discards, live releases and total catches. The Secretariat shall notify all CPCs when a CPC has reached its limit in retention based on monthl y reported landings. 12. Any retention by a CPC in excess of i ts retention allowance calculated in paragraph 5 will result in a reduction of that CPC’s allowance the following year by an amount equal to the excess. Retention by that CPC shall be prohibited until any overages are repaid in full. 270 13. No later than 31 July 2022, CPCs that reported annual average catches (landings and dead discards) of North Atlantic shortfin mako over 1 t between 2018 -2020 shall present to the SCRS the statistical methodology used to estimate dead discards and live rel eases. CPCs with artisanal and small -scale fisheries shall also provide information about their data collection programs. The SCRS shall review and approve the methods and, if it determines that the methods are not scientifically sound, the SCRS shall provide relevant feedback to the CPCs in question to improve them. 14. As part of their annual Task 1 and 2 data submissi ons, CPCs shall provide all relevant data for North Atlantic shortfin mako, including estimates of dead discards and live releases using the methods approved by the SCRS in paragraph 13. If the Compliance Committee determines that CPCs that authorize their vessels to retain on board and land North Atlantic shortfin mako pursuant to paragraph 5 fail to report their catch data, including dead discards and live releases, the CPCs concerned shall require their fishing vessels to refrain from retaining any quantity of North Atl antic shortfin mako until such data have been reported. 15. The SCRS shall evaluate the completeness of Task 1 and 2 data submissions, including estimates of total dead discards and live releases. If, after conducting this evaluation, the SCRS determines that significant gaps in data reporting exist, or, following the review in paragraph 13, that the methodology used by one or more CPCs to estimate dead discards and live releases is not scientifically sound, the SCRS shall inform the Commission that the data for those CPCs are inappropriate for inclusion in the calculation of the retention allowance. In this case, the SCRS shall estimate dead discards and live releases for those CPCs for use in the retention allowance calculation. Biological sampling and observer coverage 16. CPCs shall endeavor to gradually increase the observer coverage, including EMS, of all longline fishing vessels in ICCAT fisheries that may have potential interaction with North Atlantic shortfin mako sharks to 10%. This increase in the coverage should be implemented in accordance with provisions of Recommendation 16-14 either by means of the deployment of human observers on board vessels or through the use of EMS, taking into account minimum standards to be agreed by ICCAT, based on advice from SCRS and PWG. 17. Collection of biological samples during commercial fishing operations shall comply with the Recommendation by ICCAT on biological sampling of prohibited shark species by scientific observers (Rec. 13-10). CPCs should encourage the collection of biological data and biological samples of North Atlantic shortfin mako that are dead at haulback, such as muscle, vertebrae and reproductive tissues, consistent with the terms of this Recommendation and according to the recommendations of SCRS. 18. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, in the context of this Recommendation and only for vessels less than 15 meters, where an extraordinary safety concern exists that precludes deployment of an onboard observer, a CPC may exceptionally apply an alternative approach as set out in Recommendation 16-14. This derogation from paragraph 7, shall be without prejudice to the overall commitment of all CPCs as outlined in this measure to immediately end overfishing and to reduce mortality levels. Any CPC wishing to avail itself of this alternative approach must: 1) present the details of the approach to the SCRS based on the advice of the SCRS for evaluation and 2) obtain approval from the Commission (as stipulated in Recommendation 16-14). 271 Scientific and research activities 19. The SCRS shall continue to prioritize research into: identifying mating, pupping and nursery grounds, and other high concentration areas of North Atlantic shortfin mako; options for spatial -temporal measures; mitigation measures (inter alia, gear configuration and modification, deployment options), together with the benefits and disadvantages for the objectives of the rebuilding programme, aimed at further improving stock status; and other areas the SCRS deems helpful both to improving stock assessments and reducing shortfin mako mortality. In addition, CPCs are encouraged to investigate at- vessel and post -release mortality of shortfin mako including, but not exclusively through, the incorporation of hook-timers and of satellite tagging programs. 20. Taking into account that hotspots of incidental catches may occur in areas and periods with specific oceanographic conditions, the SCRS shall launch a pilot project to explore the benefits of installing mini data loggers on the mainline and on the branchlines of longline fishing vessels which participate in the project on a voluntary basis targeting ICCAT species that have potential interactions with shortfin mako sharks. The SCRS shall provide guidance on the basic characteristics, minimum number and positions to install the mini data loggers with a view to have a better understanding of the effects of the soaking time, fishing depths and environmental characteristics underpinning higher incidental catches of shortfin mako. 21. a) The SCRS shall provide to the Commission by 2023, and whenever new information becomes available, updated advice on mitigation measures aimed at further reducing shortfin mako mortality. For that purpose, by 30 April 2023 , CPCs shall submit to the SCRS information by fishery on the technical and other management measures they have implemented for reducing total fishing mortality of North Atlantic shortfin mako sharks , except the CPCs that have already provided this information to the Secretariat. The SCRS shall review this information and advise the Commission on which tools and approaches have been most effective at reducing fishing mortality with a view to recommending specific measures that should be considered for adoption by the Commission. b) Taking into account the information on the technical and other management measures submitted by CPCs in subparagraph a) above, the SCRS shall assess the potential benefits of both minimum and maximum size limits for live retention (applied separately or in combination) , in particular sex specific sizes at maturity based on the best available science, particularly when considered in combination with other management measures, to meet required mortality reductions. The SCRS shall advise the Commission by 2024 whether size restrictions are effective tools, especially when used in combination with other measures, to meet required mortality reductions. 22. The SCRS shall review the reported landings and discards of longfin mako shark to identify any unexpected inconsistencies that could be the result of misidentification between the two mako species, for the purpose of formulating management advice. Next stock assessments and review of measures effectiveness 23. The SCRS shall conduct a benchmark stock assessment, including producing a Kobe II strategy matrix that reflects the time frame for rebuilding up to 2070, of North Atlantic shortfin mako by 2024. Further assessments shall be carried out by 2029 and 203 4, with a view to evaluate the stock status and trajectory as well as the effectiveness of actions taken pursuant to this Recommendation and subsequent amendments to achieve the objectives of the rebuilding programme. Implementation 24. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article VIII, paragraph 2 of the Convention, CPCs are strongly encouraged to implement, in accordance with their regulatory procedures, this Recommendation as soon as possible and before the date of its entry into force. 272 25. In 2023, an intersessional meeting of Panel 4 shall take place to promote the sharing among CPCs of best practices, to reduce encounters with, and catches and fishing mortality of shortfin mako sharks. Panel 4 shall seek input from fishing operators, other relevan t stakeholders, and scientists and shall encourage their participation in this meeting. Any recommendations from this meeting for effective technical measures that have the potential to reduce fishing mortality for shortfin mako sharks shall be referred to the SCRS for its review and consideration. Based on that review, in 2024 the SCRS shall advise the Commission on the most effective technical measures that should be implemented to reduce fishing mortality for shortfin mako while also providing information and advice on the trade-off for the catches of the target species by fishery. Review and repeal 26. This Recommendation replaces and repeals the Recommendation by ICCAT on the Conservation of North Atlantic Stock of Shortfin Mako Caught in Association with ICCAT Fisheries (Rec. 19-06). 27. At its 2024 annual meeting, the Commission shall review this measure against the objectives of the rebuilding programme, taking into account advice received from the SCRS, including advice relating to paragraphs 21 (a) and (b), as well as discussions at Panel 4. 28. The Commission shall review this measure no later than the annual meeting 2024 to consider additional measures to reduce total fishing mortality. 273 Annex 1 Process to determine possible retention 1. In order to determine whether any retention is permissible, the following rules shall apply when making management decisions in year Y: a) All sources of fishing mortality for the previous year (Y -1) shall be estimated by the SCRS based on the data submitted by CPCs as well as updated scientific evidence. In the event that not all CPCs report all required data and full data sets for Y -1 (i.e. , dead discards, live releases and where allowed, retentions) or if the SCRS determines that the data provided by a CPC are not scientifically sound, the SCRS shall provide estimates as appropriate to fill any known data gaps. b) The total fishing mortality from all sources for year Y -1 as calculated in Annex 1, paragraph 1a) is subtracted from the figure established by paragraph 4. The resulting amount shall be referred to as the dead bycatch retention allowance (hereinafter ‘retention allowance’) for the following year Y+1. c) If the retention allowance established by Annex 1, paragraph 1b) is equal to or less than zero, CPCs shall prohibit retaining onboard, transshipping and landing, whole or in part, North Atlantic shortfin mako caught in association with ICCAT fisheries in year Y+1. d) If the retention allowance established by Annex 1, paragraph 1b) is greater than zero, CPCs may be eligible to retain up to the amount resulting from Annex 1, paragraph 2 below. CPC retention allowance 2. If, pursuant to Annex 1, paragraph 1d), retention is permissible, the retention allowance for each CPC will be calculated using the following formula: Individual CPC retention allowance (t) = (CPC average annual catches from 2013-2016) x (Retention Allowance) Average total ICCAT catches from 2013-2016 Where: “CPC average annual catches from 2013 -2016” is the average annual catches (reported landings + dead discards, as verified by the SCRS pursuant to the data submitted and analysis undertaken pursuant to paragraphs 13 and 15) for an individual CPC for the four years covering 2013-2016; “Retention Allowance” is defined in Annex 1, paragraph 1; and, “Average total ICCAT catches from 2013 -2016” is the average annual catches (reported landings + dead discards, as verified by the SCRS pursuant to the data submitted and analysis undertaken pursuant to paragraphs 13 and 15) across all CPCs 2013-2016. 3. CPCs must meet all the requirements within this measure in order to access any possible retention allowance. 4. Once the total amount retained by a CPC in a given year reaches that CPC’s retention allowance, that CPC must immediately prohibit retention, transshipment, and landing for the remainder of that fishing year, and the CPC shall notify immediately the Secret ariat that it has reached its retention allowance and has implemented the required prohibitions. 274 Annex 2 Minimum standards for safe handling and live release procedures The following provides minimum standards for safe handling practices of North Atlantic shortfin mako sharks (nSMA) and provides specific recommendations for both longline and purse seine fisheries. These minimum standards are appropriate for live shortfin mako sharks when released whether under no- retention policies, or when released voluntarily. These basic guidelines do not replace any stricter safety rules that may have been established by the National Authorities of individual CPCs. Safety First: These minimum standards should be considered in light of safety and practicability for crew. Crew safety should always come first. At a minimum, crew should wear suitable gloves and avoid working around the mouths of sharks. Training: The Secretariat and SCRS should develop materials to support the training of fishing operators to implement this safe handling protocol. These materials should be made available to CPCs in the three ICCAT official languages. To the greatest extent practicable, all sharks being released should remain in the water at all times unless it is necessary to lift sharks for species identification. This includes cutting the line to free the shark while it is still in the water, using b olt cutters or dehooking devices to remove the hook if possible, or cutting the line as close to the hook as possible (and so leaving as little trailing line as possible). Be prepared: T ools should be prepared in advance (e.g., canvas or net slings, stretchers for carrying or lifting, large mesh net or grid to cover hatches/hoppers in purse seine fisheries, long handled cutters and de-hookers in longline fisheries, etc., listed at the end of this document). General recommendations for all fisheries: - If operationally safe to do so, stop the vessel or substantially reduce its speed. - When entangled (in netting, fishing line, etc.), if safe to do so, carefully cut the net/line free from the animal and release to the sea as quickly as possible with no entanglements attached. - Where feasible, and while keeping the shark in the water, try to measure the length of the shark. - To prevent bites, place an object, such as a fish or big stick/wooden pole, in the jaw. - If, for whatever reason, a shark must be brought on the deck then minimise the time it takes to return it to the water to increase survival and reduce risks to the crew. Longline fisheries specific safe-handling practices: - Bring the shark as close to the vessel as possible without putting too much tension on the branchline to avoid that a released hook or branchline break could shoot hook, weights and other parts toward the vessels and crew at high speed. - Secure the far side of the longline mainline to the boat to avoid that any remaining gear in the water pulls on the line and the animal. - If hooked, and the hook is visible in the body or mouth, use a dehooking device or long -handled bolt cutter to remove the hook barb, and then remove the hook. - If it is not possible to remove the hook or the hook cannot be seen, cut the line of the trace (or snood, leader) as close to the hook as possible (ideally leaving as little line and/or leader material as possible and no weights attached to the animal). 275 Purse seine fisheries specific safe-handling practices: - If in purse seine net: Scan the net as far ahead as possible to spot the sharks early to react quickly. Avoid lifting them up in the net towards the power block. Reduce vessel speed to slacken the tension of the net and allow the entangled animal to be removed from the net. If necessary, use clippers to cut the net. - If in brail or on deck: Use a purpose-built large-mesh cargo net or canvas sling or similar device. If the vessel layout allows, these sharks could also be released by emptying the brail directly on a hopper and release ramp held up at an angle that connects to an opening on the top deck railing, without need to be lifted or handled by the crew. DO NOT (all fisheries): - To the greatest extent practicable, do not lift sharks from the water using the branchline, especially if hooked unless it is necessary to lift sharks for species identification. - Lift sharks using thin wires or cables, or by the tail alone. - Strike a shark against any surface to remove the animal from the line. - Attempt to dislodge a hook that is deeply ingested and not visible. - Try to remove a hook by pulling sharply on the branchline. - Cut the tail or any other body part. - Cut or punch holes through the shark. - Gaff or kick a shark, or insert hands into the gill slits. - Expose the shark to the sun for extended periods. - Wrap your fingers, hands or arms in the line when bringing a shark or ray to the boat (may result in serious injury). Useful tools for safe handling and release: - Gloves (shark skin is rough; ensures safe handling of shark and protects crew’s hands from bites) - Towel or cloth (a towel or cloth soaked in seawater can be placed on the eyes of the shark; used to calm sharks down) - Dehooking devices (e.g., pig tail dehooker, bolt or plier cutters) - Shark harness or stretcher (if needed) - Tail rope (to secure a hooked shark if it needs to be removed from the water) - Saltwater hose (If anticipated that it may require more than 5 minutes to release a shark, then place a hose into its mouth so seawater is moderately flowing into it. Make sure deck pump has been running several minutes before placing it in a sharks mouth) - Measuring device (e.g., mark a pole, leader and float, or a measuring tape) - Data sheet for recording all catch - Tagging gear (if applicable) 276 22-11 SHK RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON THE CONSERVATION OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC STOCK OF SHORTFIN MAKO CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force 23 June 2023) RECOGNIZING that South Atlantic shortfin mako sharks are primarily caught in association with ICCAT fisheries and that the Commission has adopted management measures for shark species considered vulnerable to overfishing in ICCAT fisheries; NOTING that the 2019 SCRS assessment concluded that since fishery development in the South predictably follows that in the North and that the biological characteristics of the stock are similar, there is a significant risk that South stock could follow a similar history to that of the North stock. If the stock declines it will, like the North stock, require a long time for rebuilding even after significant catch reductions; ACKNOWLEDGING that in 2019 the SCRS concluded that the combined probability of the stock being overfished was 32.5% and that of experiencing overfishing was 41.9% with the results for the South Atlantic considered to be highly uncertain owing to the conflict between catch and CPUE data RECALLING that according to its Convention, the stated objective of ICCAT is to maintain the stocks at levels which will permit the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY); COMMITTED to immediately taking actions to end likely overfishing of the South Atlantic shortfin mako stock, as the first step in the development of a fishery management framework; CONSIDERING that the Recommendation by ICCAT on the principles of decision making for ICCAT conservation and management measures (Rec. 11 -13) calls for the Commission to immediately adopt management measures designed to result in a high probability of ending overfishing in as short a period as possible and adopt a plan to rebuild the stock taking into account, inter alia, the biology of the stock and SCRS advice; AWARE that precautionary management measures should be considered particularly for stocks where there is the greatest biological vulnerability and conservation concern, and for which there are very few data and/or great uncertainty in assessment results; RECALLING the ecological risk assessments carried out by the SCRS in 2008 and 2012 which indicate that shortfin mako ranks third in the vulnerability table; ALSO RECALLING the approach agreed for North Atlantic shortfin mako and given the difficulty of reaching agreement it would be sensible to follow a similar approach; ALSO AWARE that the SCRS has emphasized that reporting all sources of mortality is an essential element to decrease the uncertainty in stock assessment results, and particularly the reporting of estimated dead discards for all fisheries; ALSO RECOGNIZING SCRS advice on the need for Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities, or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as CPCs) to strengthen their monitoring and data collection efforts in support of future stock assessments, inc luding but not limited to total estimated dead discards and, live releases and the estimation of CPUE using observer data; FURTHER RESPONDING to the need for additional research on methods to reduce shortfin mako interactions in ICCAT fisheries, including identifying areas with high interactions; 277 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNA (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Management plan objectives 1. The Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as “CPCs”), shall implement a fishery management plan for South Atlantic shortfin mako shark starting in 2023 to counteract overfishing i mmediately and gradually achieve biomass levels sufficient to support Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). In 2024, following the results of the South Atlantic shortfin mako stock assessment, and upon analysis of the Kobe II strategy matrix provided by the SCRS, CPCs shall agree on a catch level that ensures that the stock is in the green zone of the Kobe II strategy matrix with a probability of between 60 and 70% by 2070 (using catch increments of 100 t and time increments of 5 years). 2. Toward that end and pending the results of the 2024 assessment (including the Kobe II strategy matrix), the total fishing mortality (the sum of any retention, dead discards, and post-release mortality of live discards) for South Atlantic shortfin mako shall be no more than the minimum reported annual catch in the last five years of the assessment (i.e., 2,001 t) as set out in the 2019 SCRS Report. First step in managing the stock and process to determine permissible retention 3. CPCs shall implement a maximum retention allowance in 2023 and 2024 of 60% of their average annual catch, as reported to ICCAT between 2012 and 2021. CPCs with average annual catches of more than 500 t will implement a cap on landings of 40% of their average annual catch, as reported to ICCAT between 2012 and 2021. This is expected to allow for a total retention allowance of 1,295 t. The objective being that this retention allowance combined with the sum of estimated dead discards and post release mortality, results in a total mortality that is below the SCRS advice: CPC Mean catches 2012-2021 (t) Retention allowance (t) Angola 3 2 Belize 26 15 Brazil 347 208 China PR 4 2 Chinese Taipei 101 61 Côte d'Ivoire 29 18 Curaçao 0 0 El Salvador 0 0 European Union 1,258 503 Guatemala 0 0 Japan 103 62 Korea 6 4 Namibia 640 256 Panama 0 0 Senegal 14 8 South Africa 256 154 United Kingdom 0 0 Uruguay 4 2 TOTAL 2,791 1,295 278 4. The retention allowances described in paragraph 3 do not constitute any long term right and are without prejudice to any future process of allocation. 5. For 2025 onwards, the total fishing mortality tonnage associated with the probability level to be established in paragraph 1 shall be based on the most recent Kobe II strategy matrix provided by the SCRS in 2024 for South Atlantic shortfin mako (the probability of both F< FMSY and B> BMSY1). Following the 2024 stock assessment, the SCRS shall present the Kobe II strategy matrix consistent with the objectives established by paragraph 1. 6. Permissible retention shall be pursuant to the following process: a) Following the stock assessment in 2024 the SCRS shall use the approach in Annex 1, or alternative approaches after having their appropriateness confirmed by the SCRS, for determining the amount of permissible retention of South Atlantic shortfin mako in the future. To assist with this work, the SCRS shall, as appropriate, provide to the Commission estimates of post release mortality and, where needed, estimates of dead discards, taking into account data submitted by CPCs and other relevant information and analyses. b) Starting in 2024 and annually thereafter, the SCRS will use Annex 1 to calculate a possible level of retention, including eligible CPCs’ individual retention allowances, allowed in the subsequent year, and provide the results to the Commission. c) Starting in 2024 and annually thereafter, the Commission shall validate the amount of permissible retention in the subsequent year, based on advice from the SCRS in accordance with paragraph 6 b). 7. CPCs whose fishing vessels retain South Atlantic shortfin mako shall prohibit transshipping, whole or in part, South Atlantic shortfin mako caught in association with ICCAT fisheries. 8. From 1 January 2025, any retention permissible shall be allowed only when the fish is dead on haulback, and the vessel has an observer or a functioning electronic monitoring system (EMS) on board to verify the condition of the sharks. a) For vessels of 12 meters or less, no more than one specimen of South Atlantic shortfin mako shall be retained by a vessel for any fishing trip. b) For the purposes of this paragraph, a fishing trip is defined as the time period that begins when a fishing vessel departs from a dock, berth, beach, seawall, ramp, or port to carry out fishing operations and that terminates with a return to a dock, berth, beach, seawall, ramp, or port. Safe handling and release 9. Upon entry into force of this Recommendation, CPCs shall require vessels flying their flag to implement, while giving due consideration to the safety of the crew, the minimum standards for safe handling and release procedures of South Atlantic shortfin mako shark, as provided under Annex 2 of this Recommendation, in order to promptly release unharmed, to the extent practicable, and to improve survivability of live South Atlantic shortfin mako shark when brought alongside the vessel. Revisions to Annex 2 may be considered by the Commission as new information from the SCRS becomes available. 1 Or an acceptable proxy as determined by the SCRS during the assessment (e.g., spawning stock fecundity). 279 Requirements for reporting on implementation 10. In accordance with Rec. 18 -06, CPCs shall submit a Shark Implementation Check Sheet to provide information on how this Recommendation is being implemented. If the Compliance Committee determines that any CPC fails to report as required by Rec. 18-06, that CPC shall immediately require its fishing vessels to refrain from retaining or landing South Atlantic shortfin mako sharks until the required reporting is made to ICCAT. 11. CPCs shall report to the ICCAT Secretariat, in accordance with ICCAT data reporting requirements, total catches, including any landings, dead discards and live releases, of South Atlantic shortfin mako. The frequency of reporting shall be monthly for any permissible landings in order to closely monitor the uptake of the retention allowance. This report shall be sent to the ICCAT Secretariat within 30 days of the end of the calendar month in which the catches were made and annually for dead discards, live releases and total catches. The ICCAT Secretariat shall notify all CPCs when a CPC has reached its limit in retention based on monthly reported landings. 12. Any retention by a CPC in excess of its retention allowance as established for 2023 and 2024, and for subsequent years, as calculated in paragraph 6, will result in a reduction of that CPC’s allowance the following year by an amount equal to the excess. R etention by that CPC shall be prohibited until any overages are repaid in full. Transfers of underages by CPCs to future years shall not be permissible. 13. No later than 31 July 2023, CPCs that reported annual average catches (landings and dead discards) of South Atlantic shortfin mako over 1 t between 2018 -2020 shall present to the SCRS the statistical methodology used to estimate dead discards and live rel eases. CPCs with artisanal and small -scale fisheries shall also provide information about their data collection programs. The SCRS shall review and approve the methods and, if it determines that the methods are not scientifically sound, the SCRS shall provide relevant feedback to the CPCs in question to improve them. 14. As part of their annual Task 1 and 2 data submissions, CPCs shall provide all relevant data for South Atlantic shortfin mako, including estimates of dead discards and live releases using the methods approved by the SCRS in paragraph 13. The ICCAT Secretar iat shall ensure that the Table 1 of the Executive Summaries have space to record also the reported live releases. If the Compliance Committee determines that CPCs that authorize their vessels to retain on board and land South Atlantic shortfin mako pursuant to paragraph 6 fail to report their catch data, including dead discards and live releases, the CPCs concerned shall require their fishing vessels to refrain from retaining any quantity of South Atlantic shortfin mako until such data have been reported. 15. The SCRS shall evaluate the completeness of Task 1 and 2 data submissions, including estimates of total dead discards and live releases. If, after conducting this evaluation, the SCRS determines that significant gaps in data reporting exist, or, following the review in paragraph 13, that the methodology used by one or more CPCs to estimate dead discards and live releases is not scientifically sound, the SCRS shall inform the Commission that the data for those CPCs are inappropriate for inclusion in the calculation of the retention allowance. In this case, the SCRS shall estimate dead discards and live releases for those CPCs for use in the retention allowance calculation. Biological sampling and observer coverage 16. CPCs shall endeavour to gradually increase the observer coverage, including EMS, of all longline fishing vessels in ICCAT fisheries that may have potential interaction with South Atlantic shortfin mako sharks to 10%. This increase in the coverage should b e implemented in accordance with provisions of Recommendation 16 -14 either by means of the deployment of human observers on board vessels or through the use of EMS, taking into account minimum standards to be agreed by ICCAT, based on advice from SCRS and PWG. 280 17. Collection of biological samples during commercial fishing operations shall comply with the Recommendation by ICCAT on biological sampling of prohibited shark species by scientific observers (Rec. 13-10). CPCs should encourage the collection of biological data and biological samples of South Atlantic shortfin mako that are dead at haulback, such as muscle, vertebrae and reproductive tissues, consistent with the terms of this Recommendation and according to the recommendations of SCRS. 18. In the context of this Recommendation and only for vessels less than 15 meters, where an extraordinary safety concern exists that precludes deployment of an onboard observer, a CPC may exceptionally apply an alternative approach as set out in Recommendatio n 16-14. This derogation shall be without prejudice to the overall commitment of all CPCs as outlined in this measure to immediately end overfishing and to reduce mortality levels. Any CPC wishing to avail itself of this alternative approach must: 1) prese nt the details of the approach to the SCRS based on the advice of the SCRS for evaluation and 2) obtain approval from the Commission (as stipulated in Recommendation 16-14). Scientific and research activities 19. The SCRS shall continue to prioritize research into: identifying mating, pupping and nursery grounds, and other high concentration areas of South Atlantic shortfin mako; options for spatial -temporal measures; mitigation measures (inter alia, gear configuration and modification, deployment options), together with the benefits and disadvantages for the objectives of the rebuilding programme, aimed at further improving stock status; and other areas the SCRS deems helpful both to improving stock assessments and reducing shortfin mako mortality. In addition, CPCs are encouraged to investigate at- vessel and post -release mortality of shortfin mako including, but not exclusively through, the incorporation of hook-timers and of satellite tagging programs. 20. Taking into account that hotspots of incidental catches may occur in areas and periods with specific oceanographic conditions, the SCRS shall launch a pilot project to explore the benefits of installing mini data loggers on the mainline and on the branchlines of longline fishing vessels which participate in the project on a voluntary basis targeting ICCAT species that have potential interactions with shortfin mako sharks. The SCRS shall provide guidance on the basic characteristics, minimum number and positions to install the mini data loggers with a view to have a better understanding of the effects of the soaking time, fishing depths and environmental characteristics underpinning higher incidental catches of shortfin mako. 21. a) The SCRS shall provide to the Commission by 2024, and whenever new information becomes available, updated advice on mitigation measures aimed at further reducing shortfin mako mortality. For that purpose, by 30 April 2024, CPCs shall submit to the SCRS inf ormation by fishery on the technical and other management measures they have implemented for reducing total fishing mortality of South Atlantic shortfin mako sharks, except the CPCs that have already provided this information to the ICCAT Secretariat. The SCRS shall review this information and advise the Commission on which tools and approaches have been most effective at reducing fishing mortality with a view to recommending specific measures that should be considered for adoption by the Commission. b) Taking into account the information on the technical and other management measures submitted by CPCs in subparagraph a) above, the SCRS shall assess the potential benefits of both minimum and maximum size limits for live retention (applied separately or in combination), in particular sex specific sizes at maturity based on the best available science, particularly when considered in combination with other management measures, to meet required mortality reductions. The SCRS shall advise the Commission by 2025 whether size restrictions are effective tools, especially when used in combination with other measures, to meet required mortality reductions. 281 22. The SCRS shall review the reported landings and discards of longfin mako shark to identify any unexpected inconsistencies that could be the result of misidentification between the two mako species, for the purpose of formulating management advice. Next stock assessments and review of measures effectiveness 23. The SCRS shall conduct a benchmark stock assessment of South Atlantic shortfin mako by 2024, including producing a Kobe II strategy matrix that reflects the timeframe for ensuring the stock is in the green zone of the Kobe II strategy matrix. Further asses sments shall be carried out by 2030 and 2035, with a view to evaluate the stock status and trajectory as well as the effectiveness of actions taken pursuant to this Recommendation and subsequent amendments to achieve the objectives of this fishery management plan. Implementation 24. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article VIII, paragraph 2 of the Convention, CPCs are strongly encouraged to implement, in accordance with their regulatory procedures, this Recommendation as soon as possible and before the date of its entry into force. 25. In 2023, an intersessional meeting of Panel 4 shall take place to promote the sharing among CPCs of best practices, to reduce encounters with, and catches and fishing mortality of shortfin mako sharks. Panel 4 shall seek input from fishing operators, other relevant stakeholders, and scientists and shall encourage their participation in this meeting. Any recommendations from this meeting for effective technical measures that have the potential to reduce fishing mortality for shortfin mako sharks shall be referred to the SCRS for its review and consideration. Based on that review, in 2024 the SCRS shall advise the Commission on the most effective technical measures that should be implemented to reduce fishing mortality for shortfin mako while also providing information and advice on the tradeoff for the catches of the target species by fishery. Review and repeal 26. At its 2024 annual meeting, the Commission shall review this measure against the objectives of established in paragraph 1 of this Recommendation, taking into account advice received from the SCRS, including advice relating to paragraphs 21 a) and b), as well as discussions at Panel 4. 27. The Commission shall review this measure no later than the annual meeting 2025 to consider additional measures to reduce total fishing mortality. 282 Annex 1 Process to determine possible retention 1. In order to determine whether any retention is permissible, the following rules shall apply when making management decisions in year Y: a) All sources of fishing mortality for the previous year (Y -1) shall be estimated by the SCRS based on the data submitted by CPCs as well as updated scientific evidence. In the event that not all CPCs report all required data and full data sets for Y-1 (i.e., dead discards, live releases and where allowed, retentions) or if the SCRS determines that the data provided by a CPC are not scientifically sound, the SCRS shall provide estimates as appropriate to fill any known data gaps. b) The total fishing mortality from all sources for year Y-1 as calculated in Annex 1, paragraph 1 a) is subtracted from the figure established by paragraph 4 (this will include all the figures from the range of probabilities in the Kobe matrix that are between 60 and 70%). The resulting amount shall be referred to as the dead bycatch rete ntion allowance (hereinafter ‘retention allowance’) for the following year Y+1. c) If the retention allowance established by Annex 1, paragraph 1 b) is equal to or less than zero, CPCs shall prohibit retaining onboard, transshipping and landing, whole or in part, South Atlantic shortfin mako caught in association with ICCAT fisheries in year Y+1. d) If the retention allowance established by Annex 1, paragraph 1 b) is greater than zero, CPCs may be eligible to retain up to the amount resulting from Annex 1, paragraph 2 below. CPC retention allowance 2. If, pursuant to Annex 1, paragraph 1 d), retention is permissible, the retention allowance for each CPC will be calculated using the following formula: Individual CPC retention allowance (t) = (CPC average annual catches from 2013-2016) x (Retention Allowance) Average total ICCAT catches from 2013-2016 Where: “CPC average annual catches from 2013 -2016” is the average annual catches (reported landings + dead discards, as verified by the SCRS pursuant to the data submitted and analysis undertaken pursuant to paragraphs 14 and 16) for an individual CPC for the four years covering 2013-2016; “Retention Allowance” is defined in Annex 1 , paragraph 1; and, “Average total ICCAT catches from 2013 -2016” is the average annual catches (reported landings + dead discards, as verified by the SCRS pursuant to the data submitted and analysis undertaken pursuant to paragraphs 14 and 16) across all CPCs 2013-2016. 3. CPCs must meet all the requirements within this measure in order to access any possible retention allowance. 4. Once the total amount retained by a CPC in a given year reaches that CPC’s retention allowance, that CPC must immediately prohibit retention, transshipment, and landing for the remainder of that fishing year, and the CPC shall notify immediately the ICCAT Secretariat that it has reached its retention allowance and has implemented the required prohibitions. 283 Annex 2 Minimum standards for safe handling and live release procedures The following provides minimum standards for safe handling practices of South Atlantic shortfin mako sharks and provides specific recommendations for both longline and purse seine fisheries. These minimum standards are appropriate for live shortfin mako sharks when released whether under no- retention policies, or when released voluntarily. These basic guidelines do not replace any stricter safety rules that may have been established by the National Authorities of individual CPCs. Safety first: These minimum standards should be considered in light of safety and practicability for crew. Crew safety should always come first. At a minimum, crew should wear suitable gloves and avoid working around the mouths of sharks. Training: The ICCAT Secretariat and SCRS should develop materials to support the training of fishing operators to implement this safe handling protocol. These materials should be made available to CPCs in the three ICCAT official languages. To the greatest extent practicable, all sharks being released should remain in the water at all times unless it is necessary to lift sharks for species identification. This includes cutting the line to free the shark while it is still in the water, using bolt cutters or dehooking devices to remove the hook if possible, or cutting the line as close to the hook as possible (and so leaving as little trailing line as possible). Be prepared: Tools should be prepared in advance (e.g., canvas or net slings, stretchers for carrying or lifting, large mesh net or grid to cover hatches/hoppers in purse seine fisheries, long handled cutters and de-hookers in longline fisheries, etc., listed at the end of this document). General recommendations for all fisheries - If operationally safe to do so, stop the vessel or substantially reduce its speed. - When entangled (in netting, fishing line, etc.), if safe to do so, carefully cut the net/line free from the animal and release to the sea as quickly as possible with no entanglements attached. - Where feasible, and while keeping the shark in the water, try to measure the length of the shark. - To prevent bites, place an object, such as a fish or big stick/wooden pole, in the jaw. - If, for whatever reason, a shark must be brought on the deck then minimise the time it takes to return it to the water to increase survival and reduce risks to the crew. Longline fisheries specific safe-handling practices - Bring the shark as close to the vessel as possible without putting too much tension on the branchline to avoid that a released hook or branchline break could shoot hook, weights and other parts toward the vessels and crew at high speed. - Secure the far side of the longline mainline to the boat to avoid that any remaining gear in the water pulls on the line and the animal. - If hooked, and the hook is visible in the body or mouth, use a dehooking device or long -handled bolt cutter to remove the hook barb, and then remove the hook. - If it is not possible to remove the hook or the hook cannot be seen, cut the line of the trace (or snood, leader) as close to the hook as possible (ideally leaving as little line and/or leader material as possible and no weights attached to the animal). 284 Purse seine fisheries specific safe-handling practices - If in purse seine net: Scan the net as far ahead as possible to spot the sharks early to react quickly. Avoid lifting them up in the net towards the power block. Reduce vessel speed to slacken the tension of the net and allow the entangled animal to be rem oved from the net. If necessary, use clippers to cut the net. - If in brail or on deck: Use a purpose-built large-mesh cargo net or canvas sling or similar device. If the vessel layout allows, these sharks could also be released by emptying the brail directly on a hopper and release ramp held up at an angle that connects to an opening on the top deck railing, without need to be lifted or handled by the crew. DO NOT (all fisheries) - To the greatest extent practicable, lift sharks from the water using the branchline, especially if hooked unless it is necessary to lift sharks for species identification. - Lift sharks using thin wires or cables, or by the tail alone. - Strike a shark against any surface to remove the animal from the line. - Attempt to dislodge a hook that is deeply ingested and not visible. - Try to remove a hook by pulling sharply on the branchline. - Cut the tail or any other body part. - Cut or punch holes through the shark. - Gaff or kick a shark, or insert hands into the gill slits. - Expose the shark to the sun for extended periods. - Wrap your fingers, hands or arms in the line when bringing a shark or ray to the boat (may result in serious injury). Useful tools for safe handling and release - Gloves (shark skin is rough; ensures safe handling of shark and protects crew’s hands from bites) - Towel or cloth (a towel or cloth soaked in seawater can be placed on the eyes of the shark; used to calm sharks down) - Dehooking devices (e.g., pig tail dehooker, bolt or plier cutters) - Shark harness or stretcher (if needed) - Tail rope (to secure a hooked shark if it needs to be removed from the water) - Saltwater hose (If anticipated that it may require more than 5 minutes to release a shark, then place a hose into its mouth so seawater is moderately flowing into it. Make sure deck pump has been running several minutes before placing it in a sharks mouth) - Measuring device (e.g., mark a pole, leader and float, or a measuring tape) - Data sheet for recording all catch - Tagging gear (if applicable) 285 23-10 SHK RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO REPLACE RECOMMENDATION 19-07 ON MANAGEMENT MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF NORTH ATLANTIC BLUE SHARK CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force 18 June 2024) RECALLING that the Commission adopted the Resolution by ICCAT on Atlantic Sharks (Res. 01-11), the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning the conservation of sharks caught in association with fisheries managed by ICCAT (Rec. 04 -10), the Supplemental Recommendation by ICCAT concerning sharks (Rec. 07-06), including the obligation of CPCs to annually report Task 1 and 2 data for sharks in accordance with ICCAT data reporting procedures, and the Recommendation by ICCAT on the Development of Harvest Control Rules and of Management Strategy Evaluation (Rec. 15-07); FURTHER RECALLING that the Commission has adopted management measures for the protection of endangered shark species caught in association with fisheries managed by ICCAT and the conservation and sustainable use of commercial shark species; FURTHER RECALLING that the Commission adopted Recommendation 16 -12 on management measures for Atlantic blue shark (Prionace glauca) and subsequently adopted catch limits for the North Atlantic stock of blue shark in Recommendation 19-07 as amended in Recommendation 21-10; RECOGNIZING that Atlantic blue shark is caught in association with fisheries managed by ICCAT and that its stocks can be managed sustainably based on the advice of the SCRS; CONSIDERING that following the stock assessment undertaken in 2023, the SCRS report states that the North Atlantic blue shark stock is not overfished and is not subject to overfishing; FURTHER CONSIDERING that the 2023 SCRS Report stated “that there is a 49.6% probability that the stock currently falls within the yellow quadrant of the Kobe plot (overfished but not subject to overfishing)”, implying that a more precautionary approach to ensuring the stock remains in the green quadrant is required; FURTHER CONSIDERING that since 2019 the average yield has been below the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) level estimated at the 2023 stock assessment; NOTING that according to the 2023 SCRS report the full utilisation of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) established by Recommendation 19-07 (39,102 t) would lead to a very low probability (3%) of maintaining the stock in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot by 2033; CONSIDERING that the SCRS, having completed its latest stock assessment in 2023, recommended that the current TAC be reduced “to catch levels that will maintain the stock in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot with a high probability”; FURTHER CONSIDERING that the catch options from the 2023 assessment that result in a ≥60% probability of being in the green quadrant after 10 years are annual catches of 30,000 t or less; SEEKING, therefore, to ensure that total catch does not exceed 30,000 t through the establishment of an annual TAC; FURTHER RECALLING that the SCRS was requested to provide options for harvest control rules (HCRs), with associated limit, target and threshold reference points, following the blue shark stock assessment in Recommendation 19-07; RECALLING the provisions of the Resolution on Criteria for the Allocation of Fishing Possibilities (Res. 15-13); 286 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. To ensure the conservation and sustainable management of the North Atlantic blue shark stock in the Convention area, the following shall apply; Catch limits for blue shark 2. An annual TAC of 30,000 t for North Atlantic blue shark is established. 3. The following CPCs shall be subject to the following annual catch limits: CPC Catch limit EU 24,449 t* Japan 3,012 t** Morocco 1,644 t*** United Kingdom 25 t * This takes into account an annual transfer of 348 t to Morocco until the next stock assessment of North Atlantic blue shark by the SCRS and is without prejudice to future allocation discussions. ** This takes into account an annual transfer of 43 t to Morocco until the next stock assessment of North Atlantic blue shark by the SCRS and is without prejudice to future allocation discussions. *** This includes annual transfers of 348 t from the EU and 43 t from Japan until the next stock assessment of North Atlantic blue shark by the SCRS and is without prejudice to future allocation discussions. 4. All other CPCs shall endeavour to maintain their catches below the level of their highest annual catches over the last ten years. 5. a) Any amount caught more than the annual catch limits established in paragraph 3 shall be deducted from the respective catch limits during or before the adjustment year, in the following way: Catch year Adjustment year 2024 2026 2025 2027 2026 2028 2027 2029 2028 2030 2029 2031 b) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) above, if any CPC exceeds its catch limit during any two consecutive years, its catch limit shall be reduced by 125% of the excess harvest of the second year, and the Commission may recommend additional actions, as appropriate. c) If in any year the total catches of the North Atlantic blue shark exceed the TAC, the Commission shall review the implementation of these measures. Recording, reporting, and use of the catch information 6. Each CPC shall ensure that all catches of North Atlantic blue shark in association with ICCAT fisheries in the Convention area are recorded in accordance with the requirements set out in the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning the recording of catch by fishing vessels in the ICCAT Convention area (Rec. 03-13). 287 7. CPCs shall implement data collection programmes that ensure the reporting of accurate North Atlantic blue shark catch, effort, size and discard data to ICCAT in full accordance with the ICCAT requirements for provision of Task 1 and Task 2 data. 8. In cases where North Atlantic blue shark is not retained, CPCs shall make all reasonable efforts so that specimens caught incidentally in ICCAT fisheries be released unharmed and as soon as possible. CPCs shall report to the ICCAT Secretariat, in accordanc e with ICCAT data reporting requirements, the number of specimens released, including their status upon release (i.e., dead discards and live releases). 9. CPCs shall include in their shark implementation check sheet submitted to ICCAT pursuant to Recommendation 18-06 information on the actions they have taken domestically to monitor catches and to conserve and sustainably manage North Atlantic blue sharks. Scientific research 10. CPCs are encouraged to undertake scientific research that would provide information on key biological/ecological parameters, life -history, migrations, post -release survivorship and behavioural traits of blue sharks. Such information shall be made available to the SCRS. 11. Following up on the task given in Recommendation 19 -07, the SCRS shall inform the Commission, by 2025 on the feasibility, cost, options and tentative roadmap for developing an MSE framework (including inter alia HCR with the associated limit, target and threshold reference points) for the management of this stock in the ICCAT Convention area. Implementation and review 12. This recommendation shall be reviewed in light of the outcom e of the next stock assessment of the North Atlantic blue shark by the SCRS. 13. This Recommendation repeals and replaces Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 16-12 on management measures for the conservation of the North Atlantic blue shark caught in association with ICCAT fisheries (Rec. 19 -07) and Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 19 -07 amending the Recommendation 16 -12 on management measures for the conservation of the North Atlantic blue shark caught in association with ICCAT fisheries (Rec. 21-10). 288 23-11 SHK RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO REPLACE RECOMMENDATION 19-08 ON MANAGEMENT MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SOUTH ATLANTIC BLUE SHARK CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force 18 June 2024) RECALLING that the Commission adopted the Resolution by ICCAT on Atlantic sharks (Res. 01-11), the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning the conservation of sharks caught in association with fisheries managed by ICCAT (Rec. 04-10), the Supplemental Recommendation by ICCAT concerning sharks (Rec. 07- 06), including the obligation of CPCs to annually report Task 1 and 2 data for sharks in accordance with ICCAT data reporting procedures and the Recommendation by ICCAT on the development of harvest control rules and of management strategy evaluation (Rec. 15-07); FURTHER RECALLING that the Commission has adopted management measures for shark species considered vulnerable to overfishing and caught in association with fisheries managed by ICCAT; RECOGNIZING that Atlantic blue shar k (Prionace glauca ) is caught in association with fisheries managed by ICCAT; CONSIDERING that the last stock assessment of South Atlantic blue shark undertaken by the SCRS in 2023, concluded that the stock was not overfished but subject to overfishing; ACKNOWLEDGING that catches of blue shark in the South Atlantic have been fluctuating recently at levels higher than the Total allowable Catch ( TAC) in Recommendation 19 -08 and the 2021 Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) estimated in the 2023 stock assessment; NOTING that the SCRS advises that maintaining current catch levels is expected to lead to a rapid decline in the stock’s biomass, with a risk of falling below 20% of the estimated B MSY reference level; FURTHER CONSIDERING that according to the 2023 SCRS report a TAC of 27,711 t or less would immediately stop overfishing and will keep the stock in green quadrant of the Kobe plot with at least a 54% probability until 2033; RECOGNIZING the need to stabilize the exploitation patterns for this fishery, in particular to avoid large fluctuations of catches to the extent possible; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) whose vessels fish blue shark in association with ICCAT fisheries in the Convention area shall implement management measures to ensure the conservation and sustainable management of the South Atlantic blue shark (Prionace glauca) in line with the ICCAT Convention objectives. Catch limits for blue shark 2. An annual TAC of 27,711 t for South Atlantic blue shark is established. 289 3. The following CPCs shall be subject to the following catch limits: CPC Catch limit EU 17,405 t Brazil 3,481 t Namibia 3,238 t Japan 1,520 t Chinese Taipei 867 t a) All other CPCs shall endeavour to maintain or reduce their catches. b) If the catches of a CPC that is a coastal developing State and not included in the allocation table exceed 1,000 t in any given year, that CPC shall be automatically included in the allocation table. The catch limit of that CPC shall be set at the level of that year. c) If the catches of a CPC that is not a developing coastal State and not included in the allocation table exceed 750 t in any given year, that CPC shall be automatically included in the allocation table with a catch limit of 750 t. d) If the total annual catches or the total of the catch limits included in the allocation table exceed the TAC established in paragraph 2 above, the Commission shall review the catch limits to bring harvesting levels in line with the TAC. 4. a) Any excess of the annual catch limits established in paragraph 3 shall be deducted from the respective catch limits during or before the adjustment year, in the following way: Catch year Adjustment year 2024 2026 2025 2027 2026 2028 2027 2029 2028 2030 2029 2031 b) Notwithstanding subparagraph a) above, if any CPC exceeds its catch limit during any two consecutive years, its catch limit shall be reduced by 125% of the excess harvest, and the Commission may recommend additional actions, as appropriate. Recording, reporting, and use of the catch information 5. Each CPC shall ensure that its vessels catching South Atlantic blue shark in association with ICCAT fisheries in the Convention area record their catch in accordance with the requirements set out in the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning the recording of catch by fishing vessels in the ICCAT Convention area (Rec. 03-13). 6. CPCs shall implement data collection programmes that ensure the reporting of accurate South Atlantic blue shark catch, effort, size and discard data to ICCAT in full accordance with the ICCAT requirements for provision of Task 1 and Task 2. 7. In cases where South Atlantic blue shark is not retained, CPCs shall make all reasonable efforts so that specimens caught incidentally in ICCAT fisheries be released unharmed and as soon as possible. CPCs shall report to the ICCAT Secretariat, in accordance with ICCAT data re porting requirements, the number of specimens released, including their status upon release (alive, dead, moribund, unknown). 290 8. CPCs shall include in their shark implementation check sheet to ICCAT information on the actions they have taken domestically to monitor catches and to conserve and manage sustainably South Atlantic blue sharks. Scientific research 9. CPCs are encouraged to undertake scientific research that would provide information on key biological/ecological parameters, life -history, migrations, post -release survivorship and behavioural traits of blue sharks. Such information shall be made available to the SCRS. 10. Following up on the task given in Recommendation 19 -08, the SCRS shall inform the Commission, by 2025 on the feasibility, cost, options and tentative roadmap for developing an MSE framework (including inter alia candidate HCR with the associated candidate limit, target and threshold reference points) for the management of this stock in the ICCAT Convention area. 11. This Recommendation shall be reviewed in light of the outcomes of the next stock assessment of the South Atlantic blue shark by the SCRS. 12. This Recommendation repeals and replaces Recommendation by ICCAT on management measures for the conservation of South Atlantic blue shark caught in association with ICCAT fisheries (Rec. 19-08). 291 23-12 SHK RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT FOR THE CONSERVATION OF WHALE SHARKS (RHINCODON TYPUS) CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force: 1 January 2025) NOTING that Article 5 of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA) requires flag States of fishing vessels harvesting highly migratory species to minimise impacts on bycatch species, protect marine biodiversity and collect relevant data for the elaboratio n of appropriate science -based conservation and management measures for ensuring the protection of such species; RECALLING the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/118 that, inter alia, requests States and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), to strengthen or establish data -collection programmes to obtain reliable species -specific estimates of protected species incidentally caught in fisheries and to promote further research on the use of appropriate bycatch mitigation measures, as well as to implement the International guidelines on bycatch management and reduction of discards of the FAO; FURTHER RECALLING that other tuna RFMOs (e.g., IOTC Resolution 13/05, WCPFC CMM 2022 -04, IATTC Resolution 19 -06) have adopted conservation measures for the protection of whale sharks from interactions with fisheries falling under their purview; FURTHER NOTING that several scientific studies presented to the SCRS in recent years indicated that ICCAT fisheries, in particular those using purse seine gear, interact with whale sharks and that some purse seine fleets operating in the ICCAT Convention area already imp lement voluntarily existing best practices and procedures for the protection of whale sharks; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that the SCRS has previously advised that “Precautionary management measures should be considered for stocks where there is the greatest biological vulnerability and conservation concern, and for which there are very few data ”, which could reasonably apply to whale sharks; NOTING that, in its second performance review, in the chapter ‘Trends in the status of non -target species,’ the Review Panel recommended that “the precautionary approach be consistently applied for associated species considering that the assessments for these spe cies are highly uncertain and that their status is often poorly known”; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. CPCs shall prohibit their flagged fishing vessels from retaining on board, transhipping, or landing, in whole or in part, any specimen of whale shark (Rhincodon typus) caught in ICCAT fisheries. 2. CPCs shall prohibit their flagged fishing vessels from setting a purse seine on a school of tuna associated with a whale shark if the animal is sighted prior to the commencement of the set. 3. CPCs shall require that when a whale shark is incidentally encircled in the purse seine net, the master of the fishing vessel shall take all reasonable steps to ensure its safe release. 4. Until safe handling and release guidelines are developed and adopted pursuant to paragraph 9 below, CPCs should require the masters of their flag vessels, in taking steps to ensure the safe handling and release of a whale shark as required under paragraph 3 and while ensuring the safety of the crew, to apply the guidelines outlined in the Annex 1. 292 5. CPCs shall ensure that, consistent with the requirements of Recommendation by ICCAT to establish minimum standards for fishing vessel scientific observer programmes (Rec. 16-14), interactions with whale sharks during purse seine operations are recorded through their domestic observer programmes. The following information will also be collected : i) details of how and why the encirclement occurred, ii) the number of individuals involved during the interaction, iii) location of the interaction, iv) steps taken to ensure safe handling and release of the specimens encircled in the purse seine, and v) an assessment of the life status of the whale shark specimen(s) upon release (alive/dead/moribund/uncertain). 6. CPCs shall report the data and information collected under paragraph 5 in their Annual Reports and, in the case of data collected through observer programmes, to the Secretariat in accordance with ICCAT data reporting requirements. 7. Paragraph 1-6 shall not apply to fishing vessels operating exclusively North of 40° N or South of 40° S (i.e., outside the core geographic range of whale shark in the Atlantic Ocean). 8. The SCRS shall, in 2024, review existing data and information relating to the life history and conservation status of whale sharks, and confirm whether they meet the definition of being a taxon of the greatest biological vulnerability and conservation conc ern for which there are very few data. Should this be the case, the SCRS shall advise on the appropriateness of applying precautionary management measures in ICCAT fisheries, such as a retention ban. The SCRS may also identify options for future research a nd data collection, as well as advise on other mitigation measures for relevant ICCAT fisheries. 9. The Commission invites the SCRS to review and endorse, at its best convenience, the geographic boundaries in paragraph 7 and the guidelines for the safe release of encircled whale sharks in Annex 1, taking into account those developed in other RFMOs. 10. Noting that the effectiveness of various release methods is still to be evaluated, CPCs are encouraged to undertake research activities on handling and release practices ensuring high post release survival rates for whale sharks caught incidentally during purse seine operations. Entry into force 11. Notwithstanding Article VIII of the ICCAT Convention, CPCs shall implement this Recommendation no later than 1 January 2025 provided the terms of paragraph 12 are met. 12. Only if there is a consensus on the interpretation of the SCRS advice at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the Commission will this Recommendation enter into force as scheduled in paragraph 11. 293 Annex 1 Guidelines for safe handling and release of whale sharks 1. In the ICCAT Convention area, the following practices should be used when releasing whale sharks incidentally caught in ICCAT fisheries: - Use the sail brail or dip net to lift and release the whale sharks, an operation also defined as “brailing”. This operation is to be used when specimens smaller than 2 meters are caught, to release them directly in open water, without bringing them on board; or - Sink the cork line so the whale shark rolls out of the net. If the individual does not go out of the net by itself, place a rope under the animal and attach it to the float line to help it roll out of the net; or - Cut a few meters of the net in front of the whale shark. 2. In the ICCAT Convention area, the following practices should be avoided when releasing whale sharks incidentally caught in ICCAT fisheries: - Lifting whale sharks by tail; - Pulling whale sharks by a loop hooked around its gill or holes bored into a fin; - Gaffing; - Leaving towing ropes attached to the trunk of whale sharks; - Brailing whale sharks larger than 2 meters; - Brailing whale sharks onto the deck; - Starting the brailing process while whale shark is still in the purse seine net. 294 07-07 BYC RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON REDUCING INCIDENTAL BYCATCH OF SEABIRDS IN LONGLINE FISHERIES (Entry into force: June 4, 2008) RECOGNISING the need to strengthen mechanisms to protect seabirds in the Atlantic Ocean; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) International Plan of Action for Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds), and the IOTC Working Party on By-catch objectives; ACKNOWLEDGING that to date some Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities, or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as “CPCs”) have identified the need for, and have either completed or are near finalized, their National Plan of Action on Seabirds; RECOGNISING the concern that some species of seabirds, notably albatross and petrels, are threatened with extinction; NOTING that the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels has entered into force; RECALLING the Resolution by ICCAT on Incidental Mortality of Seabirds [Res. 02-14]; CONSCIOUS that there are on -going scientific studies which may result in the identification of more effective mitigation measures and therefore that these current measures should be considered provisional; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. The Commission shall develop mechanisms to enable CPCs to record data on seabird interactions, including regular reporting to the Commission, and seek agreement to implement such mechanisms as soon as possible thereafter. 2. CPCs shall collect and provide all available information to the Secretariat on interactions with seabirds, including incidental catches by their fishing vessels. 3. CPCs shall seek to achieve reductions in levels of seabird by -catch across all fishing areas, seasons and fisheries, through the use of effective mitigation measures. 4. All vessels fishing south of 20°S shall carry and use bird-scaring lines (tori poles): – Tori poles shall be used in consideration of the suggested tori pole design and deployment guidelines (provided for in Annex 1); – Tori lines are to be deployed prior to longlines entering the water at all times south of 20°S; – Where practical, vessels are encouraged to use a second tori pole and bird -scaring line at times of high bird abundance or activity; – Back-up tori lines shall be carried by all vessels and be ready for immediate use. 5. Longline vessels targeting swordfish using monofilament longline gear may be exempted from the requirements of paragraph 4 of this Recommendation, on condition that these vessels set their longlines during the night, with night being defined as the period between nautical dusk/dawn as referenced in the nautical dusk/dawn almanac for the geographical position fished. In addition, these vessels are required to use a minimum swivel weight of 60g placed not more than 3m from the hook to achieve optimum sink rates. 295 CPCs applying this derogation shall inform the SCRS of their scientific findings resulting from their observer coverage of these vessels. 6. The Commission shall, upon receipt of information from the SCRS, consider, and if necessary, refine, the area of application of the mitigation measures specified in paragraph 4. 7. This measure is a provisional measure which will be subject to review and adjustment in the light of future available scientific advice. 8. The Commission shall consider adopting additional measures for the mitigation of any incidental catch of seabirds at its annual meeting in 2008 based on the results of the ICCAT seabird assessment which is currently underway. 296 Annex 1 Suggested Guidelines for Design and Deployment of Tori Lines Preamble These guidelines are designed to assist in preparation and implementation of tori line regulations for longline vessels. While these guidelines are relatively explicit, improvement in tori line effectiveness through experimentation is encouraged. The guide lines take into account environmental and operational variables such as weather conditions, setting speed and ship size, all of which influence tori line performance and design in protecting baits from birds. Tori line design and use may change to take account of these variables provided that line performance is not compromised. On -going improvement in tori line design is envisaged and consequently review of these guidelines should be undertaken in the future. Tori line design 1. It is recommended that a tori line 150 m in length be used. The diameter of the section of the line in the water may be greater than that of the line above water. This increases drag and hence reduces the need for greater line length and takes account of setting speeds and length of time taken for baits to sink. The section above water should be a strong fine line (e.g. about 3 mm diameter) of a conspicuous color such as red or orange. 2. The above water section of the line should be sufficiently light that its movement is unpredictable to avoid habituation by birds and sufficiently heavy to avoid deflection of the line by wind. 3. The line is best attached to the vessel with a robust barrel swivel to reduce tangling of the line. 4. The streamers should be made of material that is conspicuous and produces an unpredictable lively action (e.g. strong fine line sheathed in red polyurethane tubing) suspended from a robust three -way swivel (that again reduces tangles) attached to the tori line, and should hang just clear of the water. 5. There should be a maximum of 5-7 m between each streamer. Ideally each streamer should be paired. 6. Each streamer pair should be detachable by means of a clip so that line stowage is more efficient. 7. The number of streamers should be adjusted for the setting speed of the vessel, with more streamers necessary at slower setting speeds. Three pairs are appropriate for a setting speed of 10 knots. Deployment of tori lines 1. The line should be suspended from a pole affixed to the vessel. The tori pole should be set as high as possible so that the line protects bait a good distance astern of the vessel and will not tangle with fishing gear. Greater pole height provides greater bait protection. For example, a height of around 6 m above the water line can give about 100 m of bait protection. 2. The tori line should be set so that streamers pass over baited hooks in the water. 3. Deployment of multiple tori lines is encouraged to provide even greater protection of baits from birds. 4. Because there is the potential for line breakage and tangling, spare tori lines should be carried onboard to replace damaged lines and to ensure fishing operations can continue uninterrupted. 5. When fishers use a bait casting machine (BCM), they must ensure coordination of tori line and machine by: (i) ensuring the BCM throws directly under the tori line protection, and (ii) when using a BCM that allows throwing to port and starboard, ensure that two tori lines are used. 6. Fishers are encouraged to install manual, electric or hydraulic winches to improve ease of deployment and retrieval of tori lines. 297 11-09 BYC SUPPLEMENTAL RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON REDUCING INCIDENTAL BY-CATCH OF SEABIRDS IN ICCAT LONGLINE FISHERIES (Entry into force: June 7, 2012) RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT on Reducing Incidental By -catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries [Rec. 07-07]; RECOGNISING the need to strengthen mechanisms to protect endangered seabirds in the Atlantic Ocean; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) International Plan of Action for Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds); ACKNOWLEDGING that to date some Contracting Parties, Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as “CPCs”) have identified the need for, and have either completed or are near finalizing, their National Plan of Action on Seabirds; RECOGNISING the concern that some species of seabirds, notably some albatrosses and petrels, are threatened with global extinction; NOTING that the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels has entered into force; NOTING that the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) has adopted Recommendation GFCM/35/2011/13 launching a process, to be carried out in coordination with other RFMOs, with a view to reducing incidental by-catch of seabirds in fisheries in the GFCM Competence Area, CONSCIOUS that the ICCAT seabird assessment has been completed and has concluded that ICCAT fisheries are having a measurable impact on seabird species; RECOGNIZING the progress that some CPCs have made in addressing seabird bycatch in their fisheries: THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. CPCs shall record data on seabird incidental catch by species through scientific observers in accordance with the Recommendation 10-1045F 1 and report these data annually. 2. CPCs shall seek to achieve reductions in levels of seabird by -catch across all fishing areas, seasons, and fisheries through the use of effective mitigation measures, while giving due consideration to the safety of crew members and the practicability of mitigation measures. 3. In the area south of 25 degrees South latitude, CPCs shall ensure that all longline vessels use at least two of the mitigation measures in Table 1. These measures should also be considered for implementation in other areas, as appropriate, consistent with scientific advice. 4. In the Mediterranean, mitigation measures in Table 1 should be implemented on a voluntary basis. The SCRS is encouraged to work in coordination with the GFCM as provided for in GFCM Recommendation 35/2011/13. 5. Mitigation measures used pursuant to paragraph 3 shall conform to the minimum technical standards for the measures as shown in Table 1. 6. The design and deployment for bird scaring lines should also meet the additional specifications provided in Annex 1. 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 10-10 and 16-14. 298 7. CPCs shall collect and provide to the Secretariat information on how they are implementing these measures and on the status of their National Plans of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries. 8. In 2015, the SCRS shall conduct another fishery impact assessment to evaluate the efficacy of these mitigation measures. Based on this fishery impact assessment, the SCRS shall make appropriate recommendations, if necessary, to the Commission on any modifications. 9. The Commission shall consider adopting additional measures for the mitigation of any incidental catch of seabirds in light of any new scientific information available, if necessary and consistently with the precautionary approach. 10. Notwithstanding Article VIII of the Convention the provisions of this Recommendation shall come into force to the extent possible by January 2013 but not later than July 2013. 11. ICCAT Rec. 07-07 will continue to apply in the area between 20oS to 25oS. 299 Table 1. Mitigation measures that comply with the following minimum technical standards. Mitigation measure Description Specification Night setting with minimum deck lighting No setting between nautical dawn and before nautical dusk. Deck lighting to be kept to a minimum Nautical dusk and nautical dawn are defined as set out in the Nautical Almanac tables for relevant latitude, local time and date. Minimum deck lighting should not breach minimum standards for safety and navigation. Bird-scaring lines (Tori lines) Bird-scaring lines shall be deployed during longline setting to deter birds from approaching the branch line. For vessels greater than or equal to 35 m: - Deploy at least 1 bird-scaring line. Where practical, vessels are encouraged to use a second tori pole and bird scaring line at times of high bird abundance or activity; both tori lines should be deployed simultaneously, one on each side of the line being set - Aerial extent of bird-scaring lines must be greater than or equal to 100 m. - Long streamers of sufficient length to reach the sea surface in calm conditions must be used. - Long streamers must be at intervals of no more than 5m. For vessels less than 35m: - Deploy at least 1 bird-scaring line. - Aerial extent must be greater than or equal to 75m. - Long and/or short (but greater than 1m in length) streamers must be used and placed at intervals as follows: o Short: intervals of no more than 2m. o Long: intervals of no more than 5m for the first 55 m of bird scaring line. Additional design and deployment guidelines for bird-scaring lines are provided in Annex 1 of this Recommendation. Line weighting Line weights to be deployed on the snood prior to setting Greater than a total of 45 g attached within 1 m of the hook or; Greater than a total of 60 g attached within 3.5 m of the hook or; Greater than a total of 98 g weight attached within 4 m of the hook. 300 Annex 1 Supplemental Guidelines for Design and Deployment of Tori Lines Preamble Minimum technical standards for deployment of tori lines are found in Table 1 of this Recommendation, and are not repeated here. These supplemental guidelines are designed to assist in preparation and implementation of tori line regulations for longline vessels. While these guidelines are relatively explicit, improvement in tori line effectiveness through experimentation is encouraged, within the requirements of Table 1 in the Recommendation. The guidelines take into account environmental and operational variables such as weather conditions, setting speed and ship size, all of which influence tori line performance and design in protecting baits from birds. Tori line design and use may change to take account of these variables provided that line performance is not compromised. On-going improvement in tori line design is envisaged and consequently review of these guidelines should be undertaken in the future. Tori line design 1. An appropriate towed device on the section of the tori line in the water can improve the aerial extension. 2. The above water section of the line should be sufficiently light that its movement is unpredictable to avoid habituation by birds and sufficiently heavy to avoid deflection of the line by wind. 3. The line is best attached to the vessel with a robust barrel swivel to reduce tangling of the line. 4. The streamers should be made of material that is conspicuous and produces an unpredictable lively action (e.g. strong fine line sheathed in red polyurethane tubing) suspended from a robust three -way swivel (that again reduces tangles) attached to the tori line. 5. Each streamer should consist of two or more strands. 6. Each streamer pair should be detachable by means of a clip so that line stowage is more efficient. Deployment of tori lines 1. The line should be suspended from a pole affixed to the vessel. The tori pole should be set as high as possible so that the line protects bait a good distance astern of the vessel and will not tangle with fishing gear. Greater pole height provides greater bait protection. For example, a height of around 7 m above the water line can give about 100 m of bait protection. 2. If vessels use only one tori line it should be set to windward of sinking baits. If baited hooks are set outboard of the wake, the streamer line attachment point to the vessel should be positioned several meters outboard of the side of the vessel that bai ts are deployed. If vessels use two tori lines, baited hooks should be deployed within the area bounded by the two tori lines. 3. Deployment of multiple tori lines is encouraged to provide even greater protection of baits from birds. 4. Because there is the potential for line breakage and tangling, spare tori lines should be carried onboard to replace damaged lines and to ensure fishing operations can continue uninterrupted. Breakaways can be incorporated into the tori line to minimize s afety and operational problems should a longline float foul or tangle with the in-water extent of a streamer line. 5. When fishers use a bait casting machine (BCM), they must ensure coordination of tori line and machine by: i) ensuring the BCM throws directly under the tori line protection, and ii) when using a BCM (or multiple BCMs) that allows throwing to both port and starboard, two tori lines should be used. 301 6. When casting branchline by hand, fishers should ensure that the baited hooks and coiled branchline sections are cast under the tori line protection, avoiding the propeller turbulence which may slow the sink rate. 7. Fishers are encouraged to install manual, electric or hydraulic winches to improve ease of deployment and retrieval of tori lines. 302 11-10 BYC RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON INFORMATION COLLECTION AND HARMONIZATION OF DATA ON BY-CATCH AND DISCARDS IN ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force: June 7, 2012) RECALLING the findings of ICCAT’s independent performance review in 2008, including the panel’s recommendation that “ICCAT develop a stronger approach generally to by -catch and develop and adopt appropriate mitigation measures including reporting on the effectiveness of these measures throughout the fisheries”; ACKNOWLEDGING the findings of the International Workshop on Tuna RFMO Management of Issues Relating to Bycatch in June 2010, including the recommendation that RFMOs should assess fishery impacts on bycatch, using the best available data; CONSIDERING that the FAO issued International Guidelines for By -catch Management and Reduction of Discards in January 2011, advising RFMOs to recognize the importance of addressing bycatch problems and to collaborate with other RFMOs to address common issues of concern; FURTHER CONSIDERING the recommendations developed at the first meeting of the Joint Tuna RFMO Technical Working Group on Bycatch in July 2011; RECOGNIZING that discussions within the Future of ICCAT Working Group have highlighted the importance of ecosystem considerations; NOTING that the Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish Minimum Standards for Fishing Vessel Scientific Observer Programs [Rec. 10-10]1 requires CPCs to establish observer programs to collect data that quantify bycatch (including sharks, sea turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds) and report this information to the SCRS; RESPONDING to recommendations from the SCRS Subcommittee on Ecosystems, including the need for all CPCs to collect and provide bycatch data to the SCRS; FURTHER RECOGNIZING that the SCRS Sub -Committee on Ecosystems, together with the Working Group on Stock Assessment Methods, is developing guidelines for the presentation and analysis of bycatch statistics; DETERMINED to improve data collection and reporting on bycatch in ICCAT fisheries, as a basis for future assessment by the SCRS of impacts of these fisheries on bycatch species and consideration of appropriate conservation and management measures by the Commission; UNDERSCORING the importance of full and active involvement by ICCAT in the work of the Joint Tuna RFMO Technical Working Group on By -Catch, including the development of minimum standards for data collection; FURTHER NOTING that although Recommendations 04 -10, 07 -07 and 10 -092 established some reporting requirements for species encountered as bycatch in ICCAT fisheries, many CPCs have not taken the necessary steps to collect and report these data.

In order to reduce bycatch and increase post-release survival of threatened and endangered sea turtle populations within the Convention area: a) CPCs with longline vessels that fish in a shallow -set manner 1 shall, while operating ICCAT fisheries, employ or implement at least one of the following methods: i. Use of only large circle hooks2 ; ii. Use of only finfish bait; or iii. Use of [an] other measure[s] or approach[es] that [has] have been reviewed and considered effective by the SCRS and approved by the Commission to be capable of reducing the interaction rate of sea turtles in shallow set longline fisheries. b) Any CPC that achieves and maintains 10% scientific observer coverage and complies with the data reporting requirements of Recs. 11 -10, 16 -14, and paragraph 6 below, may request from Paragraph 1 a) an exemption for one or more of its ICCAT fisheries above by submitting relevant scientific information to the SCRS. The SCRS will evaluate that information and advise the Commission on sea turtle interactions and mortality. The Commission shall make decisions on any requested exemption in light of the SCRS advice. 2. CPCs, while operating ICCAT fisheries, shall: a) reduce and eliminate, to the extent practicable, interactions with sea turtles in ICCAT fisheries where encounters with sea turtles have been documented and reported to the SCRS, through the use or continued use of at least one of the following bycatch mitigation measures: i. alternative or new gear types and gear modifications; ii. time-area fishing restrictions and closures based on advice from the SCRS, as appropriate, in instances where there is a higher risk of interaction with sea turtles; iii. effective static net gears’ marking allowing their detection by sea turtles (such as the use of net colours, light passive reflectors, thicker twine diameter, corks or other materials within the net); or iv. modifications in fishing behaviour and strategy (e.g., reduced soaking time, etc.). b) require that their purse seine vessels avoid encircling sea turtles to the extent practicable, release encircled or entangled sea turtles, including on fish aggregating devices (FADs), where feasible, and ensure that FADs deployed in the ICCAT Convention area are constructed according to Annex 5 of ICCAT Recommendation 22 -01 to effectively eliminate entanglement risks of sea turtles; c) take all reasonable steps to ensure the safe release of sea turtles in a manner that maximizes the likelihood of their survival by requiring that: i. their purse seine and longline vessels, and other types of vessels that use gear that may entangle sea turtles, carry on board de-hookers, line-cutters and basket lifts or dip nets , as appropriate for each gear type and consistent with the “Best practices for sea turtle handling and release” of the FAO Guidelines to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations (20093) (‘the FAO guidelines'); ii. the owners, operators, and crew of such vessels, as well as any on -board observers, use such equipment in line with the safe handling and release practices in the Appendix, and consistent with the FAO Guidelines. In addition, owners, operators and crew should be encouraged to have training in the use of such equipment. 1 Shallow-set fisheries are generally to be considered those in which the majority of hooks fish at depth shallower than 100 meters, as determined by the SCRS. 2 Circle hooks are defined as a hook with the point turned perpendicularly back to the shank to form a generally circular or oval shape. CPCs should adopt the use of circle hooks with an offset of no more than 10 degrees. 3 http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/i0725e/i0725e.pdf 306 d) require their fishermen on vessels targeting species covered by the Convention to bring aboard, if practicable, any captured sea turtle that is comatose or inactive as soon as possible and foster its recovery, including giving it resuscitation in accordance with the Appendix, before returning it to the water; e) ensure that fishermen are aware of and use proper mitigation and handling techniques, as described in the Appendix. 3. CPCs shall endeavour to increase the scientific observer coverage of longline fishing vessels in ICCAT fisheries where encounters with sea turtles have been documented and reported to the SCRS, beyond the minimum level required in Rec. 16 -14, to 10% by 1 January 2024. This increase may be achieved through human observers and/or Electronic Monitoring Systems (EMS). Th is paragraph shall be revised, as appropriate, after the adoption of minimum standards for EMS by ICCAT, based on advice from the SCRS and PWG. However, the alternative scientific monitoring approach referred to in paragraph 4 of Rec. 16 -14 remains applicable for vessels under 15 meters in replacement of EMS or observers onboard. 4. CPCs with deep -set longline, gillnet, and where appropriate, shallow-set longline fisheries are encouraged to undertake research trials aimed at mitigating bycatch and reducing bycatch mortality, and increasing post release survival of sea turtles. Research should also examine the effects of hook sizes and shapes, fishing depths, fishing areas, and seasons. CPCs shall report the results of this research (including the tradeoffs among catch rates of target and bycatch species) to the SCRS. Based on the results of such research, the SCRS shall advise the Commission on potential sea turtle mitigation measures for these fisheries. 5. Consistent with the bycatch reporting obligations under Recs. 11-10 and 16-14, each CPC shall collect, and annually report to ICCAT information on their interactions with sea turtles in ICCAT fisheries. At a minimum, this information shall include: a) date; b) location (latitude, longitude); c) fishing gear type; d) species identification; e) size (curved or straight carapace length) and/or weight; f) capture and release condition (e.g., live/dead); g) FAD type if applicable; h) bait type if applicable; i) hook type and size if applicable; j) target fishing depth; k) target species; l) fishing mode (e.g., fishing on FOBs); m) anatomical hooking location, if applicable (e.g., flipper, mouth/jaw, swallowed, entangled) if available; n) nature of entanglement if available; o) amount of gear left on the animal, if applicable (e.g., estimated length of line) if available; p) any associated photographs subject to national laws on confidentiality. 6. a) Paragraphs 1 -3 shall not apply to vessels operating only north of 55 degrees N or south of 35 degrees S latitude (i.e., primarily outside the geographic range of Atlantic sea turtles). b) In the Mediterranean Sea, i. Paragraph 1 shall not apply at this time. ii. Paragraphs 2-3 shall not apply for the period 2023 through 2025. The SCRS should review the appropriateness of the southern boundary of this range and advise the Commission in 2023. 307 7. In light of the potential impacts of climate change on ICCAT fisheries, including target stocks and bycatch species, the SCRS is requested to review periodically the provisions of this measure related to the spatio-temporal ecology of sea turtles, including their interactions and mortality associated with these fisheries. 8. In their Annual Reports to ICCAT, CPCs shall report on the steps they have taken to implement this Recommendation, including which option[ s] specified in paragraph 1 a) and paragraph 2 a) is [are] being implemented by its vessels. CPCs that qualify for the exemption specified in paragraphs 1 b) and 6 shall notify the exemption to the ICCAT Secretariat by 1 July 2023, and report the exemption in their 2023 Annual Report. CPCs shall also report to the Commission on any change in how they implement Paragraphs 1 b) and 6 b). 9. The SCRS shall continue to review any new relevant information, with respect to the provisions of this measure, on sea turtle bycatch mitigation measures and advise the Commission no later than 2025 on their effectiveness and their impacts on other species, as appropriate. As part of this work the SCRS shall analyze scientific information regarding different circle hook sizes and their effectiveness at mitigating sea turtle bycatch (decreasing catch a nd increasing post -release survival) in longline fisheries (both shallow- and deep-set longline), including the impact on catch rates of other target and non-target species. The SCRS shall also develop indicators to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation measures detailed in this Recommendation. The SCRS shall provide relevant recommendations to the Commission based on the results of this analysis. 10. The SCRS shall assess available information on the use of time-area fishing restrictions and closures in areas where there is a higher risk of interaction with sea turtles, and advise the Commission, as appropriate. 11. Considering the particular situation of coastal developing CPCs, the special funds established in Rec. 14-14, Rec. 13-19, and Res. 03-21 should be strengthened through the allocation of funds, from voluntary contributions of CPCs and inclusion of specific budget lines, to facilitate the implementation of this Recommendation, including for training fishermen on safe handling and release, providing related equipment, or supporting trials for new mitigation techniques. 12. This recommendation repeals and replaces both the Recommendation by ICCAT on the bycatch of sea turtles in ICCAT fisheries (Rec. 10-09) and the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 10- 09 on the bycatch of sea turtles in ICCAT fisheries (Rec. 13-11). 308 Appendix Safe Handling and Release Practices for Sea Turtles 1. Purse seine safe handling and release a) Whenever a sea turtle is sighted in the net, all reasonable efforts should be made to rescue the sea turtle before it becomes entangled in the net. b) No sea turtle shall be hauled from the water by a fishing line attached to, or entangled upon, the body of a sea turtle. c) If a sea turtle is entangled during net roll, the net roll should be stopped as soon as the turtle comes out of the water; the turtle should be disentangled without injuring it before resuming the net roll. d) If, in spite of the measures taken under paragraphs a and b of this section, a sea turtle is accidentally brought on board the vessel and is alive and active, or dead, the sea turtle should be released as quickly as practicable. e) If a sea turtle is brought aboard the vessel and is comatose or inactive, resuscitation should be attempted (paragraph 3). 2. Longline safe handling and release a) When practicable, and when operator or crew on board are trained, comatose sea turtles should be brought on board immediately. b) Upon sighting a sea turtle, the vessel and line reel speed should be slowed and the vessel direction adjusted to move toward the sea turtle, minimizing tension on the line. c) No sea turtle shall be hauled from the water by a fishing line attached to or entangled upon the body of a sea turtle. d) If a sea turtle is too large or hooked in such a manner as to preclude safe boarding without causing further damage/injury to the sea turtle, line clippers should be used to clip the line and remove as much line as possible prior to releasing the sea turtle. e) If a sea turtle is observed to be hooked or entangled by longline gear during hauling operations, the vessel operator should immediately cease hauling operations until the sea turtle has been removed from the longline gear or brought on board the vessel. f) If hooked externally or hook is fully visible, hooks shall be removed from sea turtles as quickly and carefully as possible. If a hook cannot be removed from a sea turtle (e.g., ingested or in roof of mouth), the line shall be cut as close to the hook as possible. g) Live sea turtles should be returned to the sea after handling: i. By putting the vessel engine in neutral gear so that the propeller is disengaged and the vessel is stopped, and releasing the sea turtle away from deployed gear; and ii. Observing that the sea turtle is safely away from the vessel before engaging the propeller and continuing operations. h) If the sea turtle brought aboard the vessel is comatose or inactive, resuscitation should be attempted (paragraph 3). 309 3. Resuscitation for a sea turtle on board a) When handling a sea turtle, attempts should be made to hold the animal by the shell, avoiding the head and neck region, and flippers. b) Strive to remove and/or disentangle any foreign items from the sea turtle, such as any plastic items, netting, or embedded hooks, etc. c) Placing the sea turtle on its bottom shell (plastron) so that the sea turtle is right side up, safely isolated and immobilized on a cushioned surface, such as an automobile tire without a rim, a boat cushion, or coil of rope. The primary purpose of the cushioned surface is to elevate the sea turtle from the deck to assist in restraining it. Elevate its hindquarters at least 6 inches (15 cm) for a period of 4 up to 24 hours. The amount of the elevation depends on the size of the turtle; greater elevations are needed for larger sea turtles. Periodically, rock the sea turtle gently left to right and right to left by holding the outer edge of the shell (carapace) and lifting one side about 3 inches (8 cm) then alternate to the other side. Gently touch the eye an d pinch the tail (reflex test) periodically to see if there is a response. d) Sea turtles being resuscitated should be shaded and kept damp or moist but under no circumstance be placed into a container holding water. A water -soaked towel placed over the head, carapace, and flippers is the most effective method in keeping a sea turtle moist. e) Sea turtles that revive and become active should be released over the stern of the boat only when fishing gear is not in use (i.e., not actively being set or hauled), when the engine gears are in neutral position, and in areas where they are unlikely to be recaptured or injured by vessels. f) Sea turtles that fail to respond to the reflex test or fail to move within 4 hours (up to 24, if possible) shall be returned to the water in the same manner as that for actively moving sea turtles. 310 23-13 BYC SUPPLEMENTAL RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT AMENDING RECOMMENDATION 22-12 ON THE BYCATCH OF SEA TURTLES CAUGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force 18 June 2024) RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT on the bycatch of sea turtles caught in association with ICCAT fisheries (combine, streamline, and amend Recommendations 10-09 and 13-11) (Rec. 22-12); RECOGNIZING the new scientific advice provided by the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) on the southern boundary of the range of sea turtles, as called for by paragraph 6 of Rec. 22-12; NOTING the need to correct a cross-reference in Rec. 22-12; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. The provisions of the Recommendation by ICCAT on the bycatch of sea turtles caught in association with ICCAT fisheries (combine, streamline, and amend Recommendations 10-09 and 13-11) (Rec. 22-12) shall be amended as follows: A. Sub-paragraph 1 b) shall be replaced with the following: “Any CPC that achieves and maintains 10% scientific observer coverage and complies with the data reporting requirements of Recs. 11 -10, 16 -14, and paragraph 5 below, may request from paragraph 1 a) an exemption for one or more of its ICCAT fisheries above by submitting relevant scientific information to the SCRS. The SCRS will evaluate that information and advise the Commission on sea turtle interactions and mor tality. The Commission shall make decisions on any requested exemption in light of the SCRS advice.” B. Sub-paragraph 6 a) shall be replaced with the following: “Paragraphs 1-3 shall not apply to vessels operating only North of 55°N or South of 35°S latitude in the eastern South Atlantic and South of 40°S latitude in the western South Atlantic (i.e., primarily outside the geographic range of Atlantic Sea turtles). The limit for the division between the eastern South Atlantic and the western South Atlantic is 20°W”. 311 23-15 BYC RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ON CETACEAN ENCIRCLEMENT (Official transmission: 18 December 2023) RECOGNIZING the potential for interactions between cetaceans and ICCAT fisheries; CONCERNED about the incidental mortality or serious injury to cetaceans that may occur in ICCAT fisheries; RECALLING that under the Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish Minimum Standards for Fishing Vessel Scientific Observer Programmes (Rec. 16 -14), Contracting Parties, non -Contracting Parties, Entities and Fishing Entities (CPCs) shall require observers in their domestic scientific observer programmes to record and report on, inter alia, the bycatch of marine mammals, including cetaceans; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES AS FOLLOWS: 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities, and Fishing Entities (CPCs) are strongly encouraged to prohibit their flag vessels from intentionally setting purse seine nets on a school of tunas in the ICCAT Convention area if a cetacean is sighted in or above the tuna school. 2. In the event that a cetacean is unintentionally encircled in the purse seine net, CPCs are encouraged to require the master of the vessel: a) to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to ensure its safe release while taking into consideration the safety of the crew; b) to report the incident to the relevant authority of the flag State , including details of the species (if known) and number of individuals, location and date of such encirclement, steps taken to ensure safe release, and an assessment of the disposition of the animal on release (including, if known, whether the animal was released alive but subsequently died). 3. Each year, CPCs are encouraged to report on the implementation of this Resolution as part of their Annual Report. 4. The Commission requests that the SCRS, to the extent possible, develop further best practice guidelines for the safe handling and release of cetaceans caught in association with ICCAT fisheries, taking into account relevant guidelines already developed by relevant international organizations, and that these guidelines be submitted to the 2025 annual meeting for consideration and adoption by the Commission. 5. CPCs are encouraged to ensure that fishermen are aware of and use proper mitigation, identification, handling and release techniques and keep on board all necessary equipment for the safe release of cetaceans before the guidelines mentioned in paragraph 4 are developed and adopted. 312 75-02 GEN ICCAT SCHEME OF JOINT INTERNATIONAL INSPECTION Agreed by the Commission November 1975 Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article IX of the Convention, the Commission recommends the establishment of the following arrangements for international control outside the waters under national jurisdiction for the purpose of ensuring the application of the Convention and the measures in force thereunder: 1. Control shall be carried out by inspectors of the fishery control services of Contracting Governments. The names of the inspectors appointed for that purpose by their respective governments shall be notified to the Commission. 2. Ships carrying inspectors shall fly a special flag or pennant approved by the Commission to indicate that the inspector is carrying out international inspection duties. The names of the ships so used for the time being, which may be either special inspect ion vessels or fishing vessels, shall be notified to the Commission, as soon as may be practical. 3. Each inspector shall carry a document of identity supplied by the authorities of the flag state in a form approved by the Commission and given him on appointment stating that he has authority to act under arrangements approved by the Commission. 4. Subject to the arrangements agreed under paragraph (9), a vessel employed for the time being in fishing for tuna or tuna -like fishes in the Convention area outside the waters under national jurisdiction shall stop when given the appropriate signal in the International Code of Signals by a ship carrying an inspector unless actually carrying out fishing operations, in which case it shall stop immediately once it has finished such operations. The master 50F 1 of the vessel shall permit the inspector, who may be accompanied by a witness, to board it. The master shall enable the inspector to make such examination of catch or gear and any relevant documents as the inspector deems necessary to verify the observance of the Commission's recommendations in force in relation to the flag state of the vessel concerned and the inspector may ask for any explanations that he deems necessary. 5. On boarding the vessel an inspector shall produce the document described in (3) above. Inspections shall be made so that the vessel suffers the minimum interference and inconvenience and that degradation of the quality of the fish be avoided. An inspector shall limit his enquiries to the ascertainment of the fact in relation to the observance of the Commission's recommendations in force in relation to the flag state of the vesse1 concerned. In making his examination an inspector may ask the master for a ny assistance he may require. He shall draw up a report of his inspection in a form approved by the Commission. He shall sign the report in the presence of the master of the vessel who shall be entitled to add or have added to the report any observations which he may think suitable and must sign such observations. Copies of the report shall be given to the master of the vessel and to the inspector’s government who shall transmit copies to the appropriate authorities of the flag state of the vessel and to the Commission. Where any infringement of the recommendations is discovered the inspector should, where possible, also inform the competent authorities of the flag state, as notified to the Commission, and any inspection ship of the flag state known to be in the vicinity. 6. Resistance to an inspector or failure to comply with his directions shall be treated by the flag state of the vessel in a manner similar to resistance to any inspector of that state or a failure to comply with his directions. 7. Inspectors shall carry out their duties under these arrangements in accordance with the rules set out in this Recommendation but they shall remain under the operational control of their national authorities and shall be responsible to them. 1Master refers to the individual in charge of the vessel. 313 8. Contracting Governments shall consider and act on reports of foreign inspectors under these arrangements on a similar basis in accordance with their national legislation to the reports of national inspectors. The provisions of this paragraph shall not imp ose any obligation on a Contracting Government to give the report of a foreign inspector a higher evidential value than it would possess in the inspector’s own country. Contracting Governments shall collaborate in order to facilitate judicial or other proceedings arising from a report of an inspector under these arrangements. 9. (i) Contracting Governments shall inform the Commission by the 1st of March each year of their provisional plans for participation in these arrangements in the following year and the Commission may make suggestions to Contracting Governments for the coordination of national operations in this field including the number of inspectors and ships carrying inspectors. (ii) The arrangements set out in this recommendation and the plans for participation shall apply between Contracting Governments unless otherwise agreed between them; and such agreement shall be notified to the Commission . Provided, however, that implementation of the scheme shall be suspended between any two Contracting Governments if either of them has notified the Commission to that effect, pending completion of an agreement. 10. (i) The fishing gear shall be inspected in accordance with the regulations in force for the subarea in which the inspection takes place. The inspector will state the nature of the violation in his report. (ii) Inspectors shall have the authority to inspect al1 fishing gear in use or that fishing gear on deck ready for use. 11. The inspector shall affix an identification mark approved by the Commission to any fishing gear inspected which appears to be in contravention of the Commission’s recommendations in force in relation to the flag state of the vessel concerned and shall record this fact in his report. 12. The inspector may photograph the gear in such a way as to reveal those features which in his opinion are not in conformity with the regulation in force, in which case the subjects photographed should be listed in the report and copies of the photographs should be attached to the copy of the report to the flag state. 13. The inspector shall have authority, subject to any limitations imposed by the Commission, to examine the characteristics of catches, to establish whether the Commission's recommendations are being complied with. He shall report his findings to the authorit ies of the flag state of the inspected vessel as soon as possible. ICCAT Pennant 314 96-14 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT REGARDING COMPLIANCE IN THE BLUEFIN TUNA AND NORTH ATLANTIC SWORDFISH FISHERIES (Entry into force: August 4, 1997) CONSIDERING that the 1996 SCRS has identi fied Atlantic bluefin tuna and N orth Atlantic swordfish stocks as over-exploited; GIVEN that statistics indicate that some Contracting Parties have exceeded their catch limits; and, RECOGNIZING that compliance with catch limits is essential to conservation of Atlantic bluefin tuna and North Atlantic swordfish. THEREFORE, with respect to the harvest of bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic, the eastern Atlantic, and the Mediterranean Sea, and swordfish in the North Atlantic, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. At the 1997 Commission Meeting, and each year thereafter, each Contracting Party whose landings, as provided in the Task I data, exceeded its catch limit for that species in the previous fishing year will explain to the Compliance Committee how the over-harvest occurred, and the actions already taken, or to be taken to prevent further over-harvest; 2. If, in the applicable management period, beginning in 1997, and each subsequent management period, any Contracting Party exceeds its catch limit, its catch limit will be reduced in the next subsequent management period by 100% of the amount in excess of s uch catch limit; and ICCAT may authorize other appropriate actions; and 3. Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if any Contracting Party exceeds its catch limit during any two consecutive management periods, the Commission will recommend appropriate measures, which may include, but are not limited to, reduction in the catch limit equa l to a minimum of 125% of the excess harvest, and, if necessary, trade restrictive measures. Any trade measures under this paragraph will be import restrictions on the subject species and consistent with each Party's international obligations. The trade measures will be of such duration and under such conditions as the Commission may determine. Treatment of Contracting Party under -harvest may be addressed as part of the Recommendation regarding total catch limits in the following management period. 315 96-15 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ON LARGE-SCALE PELAGIC DRIFTNETS (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 3 February 1997) CONSIDERING that in November, 1993, and November, 1994, ICCAT adopted Resolutions in support of the Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, 44/225, 45/197 and 46/215, concerning large - scale, high seas, pelagic driftnets and their impact on the living marine resources of the world's oceans and seas, requesting its Contracting Parties to support these Resolutions; CONSIDERING that it was brought to the attention of the Contracting Parties of the Commission that in 1995 such large -scale, high seas, pelagic driftnet fishing continued in the areas of ICCAT competence and that this activity in some fisheries was increasing; CONSIDERING that the Commission continues to express its concern about the possibility that certain stocks under ICCAT mandate, as well as other marine resources, are being adversely affected by such fishing; and CONSIDERING that the Commission has reaffirmed its commitment as regards the concept of responsible fishing, such as established within the framework of the FAO Code of Conduct, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT): REAFFIRMS the importance it gives to compliance with the Resolutions of the United Nations 44/225, 45/197 and 46/215, EXPRESSES its appreciation for the individual and collective efforts made by some of its members to apply and support the objective of these Resolutions. REITERATES its serious concern about the potential negative impacts that large -scale pelagic driftnet fishing can have on the marine resources of the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, and its intention to carefully monitor the repercussions of this fishing on these stocks. APPEALS to all its Contracting Parties to apply these Resolutions in their entirety and inform the Commission and the Secretary General of the United Nations on the regulatory measures adopted with a view towards assuring their application, in accordance with the Decisions of the United Nations 47/443 and 48/445. APPEALS to all its Contracting Parties to commit themselves immediately as concerns their application, assuring that their nationals and their fishing vessels comply with Resolution 46/215, to provide all the necessary data relative to these fisheries in order tha t the scientists can study the effects of the utilization of these gears, and imposing adequate sanctions on their nationals and on their fishing vessels that act contrary to the terms of Resolution 46/215. CHARGES the Compliance Committee and the Permanent Working Group for the Improvement of ICCAT Statistics and Conservation Measures (PWG) to monitor compliance with the U.N. Resolutions within the ICCAT Convention Area with a view to adopting adequate measures. 316 97-01 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE WITH MINIMUM SIZE REGULATIONS (Entry into force: June 13, 1998) RECOGNIZING that some Contracting Parties are not complying with the minimum size regulations for ICCAT stocks; ACKNOWLEDGING that compliance with minimum size regulations would improve the state of ICCAT stocks; NOTING THAT to better assess all harvest of ICCAT stock, parties, entities or fishing entities should make every effort to submit timely and complete Task II information (catch and effort statistics in detailed time/area strata and size data by ICCAT sampling areas and quarterly periods). Therefore, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS: 1. That Contracting Parties immediately implement measures to ensure the monitoring and enforcement of the minimum size regulations for ICCAT stocks; 2. That at the 1998 Commission meeting, and each year thereafter, each Contracting Party who has harvested any bluefin tuna weighing less than 3.2 kg, or whose harvest of any ICCAT stock exceeds the specified minimum size tolerance level adopted by the Commi ssion, explain to the Compliance Committee: a) The magnitude of the over-harvest; b) Domestic measures implemented to avoid further over-harvest; c) Monitoring of compliance with domestic measures; and d) Any other actions to be taken to prevent further over-harvest; 3. That beginning at the 2000 Commission Meeting, if any Contracting Party's actions pursuant to paragraph (2) have failed to prevent further over-harvest, the Commission may recommend measures to reduce harvest of undersized fish, which may include, but are not limited to, time and area closures, assignment of small fish quotas, and/or gear restrictions. 317 97-08 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT REGARDING COMPLIANCE IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC SWORDFISH FISHERY (Entry into force on September 24, 1998) (Except for Brazil, South Africa and Uruguay who presented and reaffirmed objections) RECOGNIZING that at its 1997 meeting the Commission addressed South Atlantic swordfish quotas; NOTING that compliance with the quotas is essential to effective implementation; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: The Recommendation by ICCAT Regarding Compliance in the Bluefin Tuna and North Atlantic Swordfish Fisheries, adopted by the Commission at its Tenth Special Meeting (November 1996), be extended to include compliance in the South Atlantic swordfish fishery. 318 98-11 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT CONCERNING THE BAN ON LANDINGS AND TRANSHIPMENTS OF VESSELS FROM NON-CONTRACTING PARTIES IDENTIFIED AS HAVING COMMITTED A SERIOUS INFRINGEMENT (Entry into force: June 21, 1999) RECOGNIZING the importance of ensuring compliance of vessels from non-contracting parties, entities or fishing entities with ICCAT rules; CONSIDERING that ICCAT adopted in November 1997 a Recommendation concerning the transhipments and vessel sightings and that, therefore, Contracting Parties of ICCAT have an obligation to report immediately the sightings of vessels from non-contracting parties, entities or fishing entities fishing in contravention to ICCAT rules; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. A vessel flying the flag of a non-contracting party, entity or fishing entity, which has been sighted in the ICCAT Convention Area, in conformity with the conditions of paragraph 4 of the Recommendation by ICCAT on Transshipment and Vessel Sightings (Rec. 97-11)1, adopted in November 1997, is presumed to be undermining ICCAT conservation measures. 2. When a vessel of a non-contracting party, entity or fishing entity referred to in paragraph 1 enters voluntarily a port of any Contracting Party, it shall be inspected by authorized Contracting Party officials knowledgeable of ICCAT measures and shall not be allowed to land or tranship any fish until this inspection has taken place. Such inspections shall include the vessel's documents, logbooks, fishing gear, catch on board and any other matter relating to the vessel's activities in the Convention Area. 3. Landings and transhipments of all fish from vessels of a non -contracting party, entity or fishing entity which have been inspected pursuant to paragraph 2, shall be prohibited in all Contracting Party ports if such inspection reveals that the vessel has onboard species subject to ICCAT conservation measures, unless the vessel establishes that the fish were caught outside the Convention Area or in compliance with the relevant ICCAT conservation measures and requirements under the Convention. 4. Information on the results of all inspections of vessels of non -contracting parties, entities or fishing entities, conducted in the ports of Contracting Parties, and any subsequent action, shall be transmitted immediately to the Commission. The Secretaria t shall transmit this information to all Contracting Parties and to the relevant flag State(s). 1 This measure was repealed and replaced by Recommendation 19-09. 319 99-11 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT CALLING FOR FURTHER ACTIONS AGAINST ILLEGAL, UNREGULATED AND UNREPORTED FISHING ACTIVITIES BY LARGE-SCALE LONGLINE VESSELS IN THE CONVENTION AREA AND OTHER AREAS (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: December 16, 1999) RECALLING that ICCAT adopted at its 1998 meeting a Resolution by ICCAT Concerning Unreported and Unregulated Catches of Tunas by Large Scale Longline Vessels in the Convention Area, and a Recommendation Concerning Registration and Exchange of Information of Bigeye Tuna Fishing Vessels, BEING CONCERNED that illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing activities by large scale tuna longline vessels activities in the Convention a rea have continued and increased, and that such activities diminish the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures, RECOGNIZING that there is evidence to indicate that many owners of vessels engaged in such fishing activities have reflagged their vessels to avoid compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures and to evade the non-discriminatory trade restrictive measures that ICCAT has adopted, BEING CONCERNED that many of these vessels are shifting their flag from Non -Contracting Parties to Contracting Parties, BEING INFORMED that most of these vessels are owned and operated by Chinese Taipei's business entities while almost all of their products are being exported to Japan, BEING AWARE that a majority of these vessels used to be Japanese vessels and were exported, whereas most of the remaining vessels were built in Chinese Taipei, SUPPORTING the joint effort by Japan and Chinese Taipei to eliminate large-scale tuna longline vessels engaged in illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, i.e. scrapping of Japanese origin vessels and reflagging of Chinese Taipei built vessels to Chinese Taipei under its own registration, RECOGNIZING with grave concern that a number of large-scale tuna longline vessels which are currently under construction in the Chinese Taipei's shipping yards with equipment/devices largely supplied from Japan, have high potential of engaging in illegal, unregulated, and unreported unregulated fishing activities, BEING AWARE that further action must be taken to deter unreported and unregulated fishing activities in the Convention Area and other areas, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. The Contracting Parties, Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities shall ensure that large -scale tuna longline vessels under their registry do not carry out illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities in the Convention a rea and other areas (e.g. by means of denying such vessels a license to fish). 2. The Co ntracting Parties, Cooperating n on-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities shall take every possible action, consistent with the relevant laws, i) to urge their importers, transporters and other concerned business people to refrain from engaging in transaction and transshipment of tunas and tuna -like species caught by vessels carrying out illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities in the Convention area and other areas. ii) to inform their general public of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities by tuna longline vessels which diminish the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures and urge them not to purchase fish harvested by such vessels, and 320 iii) to urge their manufacturers and other concerned business people to prevent their vessels and equipment/devices from being used for the illegal, unregulated and unreported longline fishing operations in the Convention area and other areas. 3. The Commission urges all non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities not referred to above to act in conformity with operative paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Resolution. 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Commission praises Chinese Taipei's effort to establish a proper scheme to allow the registration of Chinese Taipei built vessels which have engaged in illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities and urges Chinese Taipei to continue and strengthen this effort. The Commission also urges Japan, in cooperation with Chinese Taipei, to scrap Japan -built vessels engaged in illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities in the Convention area and other areas. 321 99-12 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT CONCERNING THE NEED FOR NEW APPROACHES TO DETER ACTIVITIES THAT DIMINISH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ICCAT CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: December 16, 1999) RECOGNIZING that ICCAT has adopted a wide variety of conservation and management measures designed to attain the goal of the Convention of maximum sustainable catches of tuna and tuna-like species in the ICCAT Convention Area; CONCERNED that, despite the adoption of these measures, more than half of the major stocks of species managed by the Commission continue to be at levels below that necessary to provide maximum sustainable catch, while most other stocks appear to be at or near full exploitation levels; REAFFIRMING the responsibility of flag States to ensure that vessels flying their flags do not engage in fishing activities that diminish the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures, such as those adopted by ICCAT; NOTING that the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 1993 Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measure by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, which set forth in detail the responsibility of flag States in this regard, have not yet entered into force; AWARE that some flag States remain unable or unwilling to fulfill this responsibility; ENDORSING, in this regard, paragraph 33 of the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity, adopted in 1999 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (“FAO”), which provides that “States should recognize the need to deal with the problem of those States which do not fulfill their responsibilities under international law as flag States with respect to their fishing vessels, and in particular those which do not exercise effectively their jurisdiction and control ov er their vessels which may operate in a manner that contravenes or undermines relevant rules of international law and international conservation and management measures”; CONVINCED that, to deal with this problem successfully, Contracting Parties, Non -Contracting Parties, Entities and Fishing Entities need to consider new measures and approaches beyond those that have been adopted by ICCAT to date; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. The Commission fully endorse the initiative of the FAO to develop an international plan of action to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing and encourages all Contracting Parties, Non - Contracting Parties, Entities and Fishing Entities to participate actively in this undertaking. 2. All Contracting Parties that have not yet done so should consider becoming party to the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Manageme nt of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, as well as the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measure by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas as soon as possible. 3. The Commission encourages each Contracting Party, n on-Contracting Party, Entity and Fishing Entity to participate in efforts to ensure the sustainability of marine living resources in the Convention area, as called for in the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity. 322 00-14 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH MANAGEMENT MEASURES WHICH DEFINE QUOTAS AND/OR CATCH LIMITS (Entry into force: June 26, 2001) RECOGNIZING that the Recommendation by ICCAT Regarding Compliance in the Bluefin Tuna and North Atlantic Swordfish Fisheries was adopted at the 1996 Commission meeting and it was extended to include compliance in the South Atlantic swordfish fishery at the 1997 Commission meeting; NOTING the treatment of overage and underage differs among the stocks and this complicates quota management and compliance; RECOGNIZING the need to simplify the rules by generalizing the treatment of overage and underage to avoid future confusion; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: For any species under quota/catch limit management, underages/overages from one year may be added to/must be subtracted from the quota/catch limit of the management period immediately after or one year after that year, unless any recommendation on a stock specifically deals with overages/underages, in which case that recommendation will take precedence. 323 01-12 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT REGARDING THE TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT OF QUOTAS (Entry into force: August 21, 2002) RECOGNIZING the results of the ICCAT Working Group on Allocation Criteria, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Any temporary quota adjustments shall be done only under authorization by the Commission. 324 01-13 GEN – SUPPLEMENTAL RECOMMENDATION – COMPLIANCE IN THE ATLANTIC BFT & SWO FISHERIES (Entry into force: August 21, 2002) RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT Regarding Compliance in the Bluefin Tuna and North Atlantic Swordfish Fisheries adopted at the 1996 Commission Meeting, and the Recommendation by ICCAT Regarding Compliance in the South Atlantic Swordfish Fishery, adopted at the 1997 Commission Meeting; AWARE that all the Contracting Parties may not have the necessary data at the moment to establish catch limits for a management period immediately following a management period during which overfishing was reported, and are not in condition to respect the provisions of application stipulated under paragraph 2 of the 1996 Recommendation by ICCAT Regarding Compliance in the Bluefin Tuna and North Atlantic Swordfish Fisheries, which were also applicable to the South Atlantic swordfish fisheries; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Notwithstanding paragraph 2 of th e 1996 Recommendation by ICCAT Regarding Compliance in the Bluefin Tuna and North Atlantic Swordfish Fisheries (Rec. 96 -14) which is also applicable to the South Atlantic swordfish fisheries, all unused portion (if this is specified in the pertinent management recommendation) or excess of the annual quota/catch limit shall be deducted from/may be added to, according to the case, the respective quota/catch limit during or before the adjustment year, in the following way: Catch year Adjustment year North Atlantic swordfish 2000 2002 2001 2003 2002 2004 East Atlantic/Mediterranean bluefin tuna 1999 2001 2000 2002 2001 2003 325 01-18 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT FURTHER DEFINING THE SCOPE OF IUU FISHING (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: March 22, 2002) RECALLING that ICCAT adopted at its 1999 meeting a Resolution by ICCAT Calling for Further Actions Against Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported Fishing Activities by Large -scale Longline Vessels in the Convention Area and Other Areas; RECOGNIZING that the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported Fishing of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations establishes in Section 3.1 a clear definition of what constitutes IUU fishing; MINDFUL of the need to ensure that actions taken to support ICCAT conservation and management measures are non-discriminatory and in accordance with international law; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities and Fishing Entities shall take every possible action, consistent with relevant laws, to instruct their importers, transporters, and other concerned business people to refrain from engaging in transaction and transshipment of tunas and tuna -like species caught by vessels carrying out illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing activities, which include, inter alia, any fishing not in compliance with relevant ICCAT conservation and manage ment measures, in the Convention Area or other areas. 326 02-26 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT CONCERNING COOPERATIVE ACTIONS TO ELIMINATE ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED FISHING ACTIVITIES BY LARGE-SCALE TUNA LONGLINE VESSELS (Transmit ted to Contracting Parties: December 4, 2002) RECALLING that ICCAT adopted at its 1999 meeting a Resolution by ICCAT Calling for Further Actions against Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported Fishing Activities by Large -Scale Longline Vessels in the Convention Area and Other Areas, in which ICCAT urged Japan and Chinese Taipei to scrap or to re-register to Chinese Taipei those vessels, RECALLING that ICCAT, at its 2000 meeting, praised and strongly supported the Joint Programs implemented by Japan and Chinese Taipei to eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) large-scale tuna longline vessels (LSTLVs) in its Supplemental Resolution by ICCAT to Enhance the Effectiveness of the ICCAT Measures to Eliminate Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported Fishing Activities by Large -Scale Tuna Longline Vessels in the Convention Area and Other Areas, RECOGNIZING that the ICCAT Ad Hoc Working Group on Measures to Combat IUU Fishing in Tokyo 2002 stressed the importance of the collaborative work between Chinese Taipei and Japan to study further the involvement of Chinese Taipei’s residents and licensed vessels in IUU fishing and other a ctivities assisting IUU fishing, and to work out effective measures to prevent such involvement, RECOGNIZING that ICCAT adopted at its 2002 meeting a Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning Establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels Over 24 Meters Authorized to Operate in the Convention Area [02- 22]53 1 (the Recommendation), CONCERNED that still around 100 IUU LSTLVs exist, while the Japan/Chinese Taipei Joint Program resulted in contracts for scrapping of 43 vessels and agreements for re-registration of 34 vessels, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. Japan and Chinese Taipei should further work together to eliminate the remaining IUU LSTLVs owned and/or operated by Chinese Taipei’s residents. 2. Japan should work closely with the flag States of LSTLVs and if appropriate take joint action, so as to implement the Recommendation smoothly and satisfactorily and to achieve the objective of paragraph 1 above. 3. The Commission urges Chinese Taipei to consider adopting appropriate domestic legislation to improve its ability to control its residents that invest in or otherwise support or engage in IUU fishing. 4. Contracting Parties, Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities should urge and may instruct their residents to refrain from engaging in and/or associating with activities that may support IUU tuna longline fishing vessels and with any other activities that undermine the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures. 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 09-08, 11-12, 13-13 and 21-14. 327 02-31 GEN GENERAL OUTLINE OF INTEGRATED MONITORING MEASURES ADOPTED BY ICCAT NEEDS AND PRINCIPLES The monitoring measures should respond to the peculiarities of the different ICCAT areas and fisheries. These measures should be applied by the Contracting Parties and mutatis mutandis by Cooperating non - Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities. Effective monitoring measures should embody a number of principles, namely: i Consistency with the ICCAT Convention and existing relevant international law. ii Evaluation of the current ICCAT measures and possibly complementing them with new measures. iii The general obligation to co-operate and a commitment to implement the following measures with transparency, taking into account requirements for confidentiality. iv Two types of measures should be applied: – Measures applicable to all fisheries. Measures concerning vessels would apply only to vessels beyond a certain size. – Measures applicable on a case -by-case basis to certain fisheries, taking cost -effectiveness into account. v Contribution to the improvement of the collection and timely transmission of statistics, for scientific as well as monitoring purposes. vi Provision of a means to ensure compliance by both Contracting and non-Contracting Parties, and to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the ICCAT Convention Area. vii The special requirements of developing States should be fully recognized and active co -operation should be established to facilitate the implementation of the measures by them. Under these circumstances, the ICCAT monitoring measures should consist of the following basic components: 1. Flag State duties The following monitoring measures should be taken by the flag States in regard to vessels entitled to fly their flags in the ICCAT Convention area: i Control of their vessels by: a) adopting measures so that their vessels comply with and do not undermine ICCAT conservation and management measures; b) authorizing their vessels to fish in the ICCAT Convention Area by means of fishing authorizations, licenses, or permits; c) ensuring they do not authorize vessels to fish in the ICCAT Convention Area unless they are able to effectively exercise their responsibilities in respect of such vessels, including monitoring and controlling their fishing activities; 328 d) ensuring that their vessels do not conduct unauthorized fishing within areas under the national jurisdiction of other States, through appropriate cooperation with coastal States concerned, and other relevant means available to the flag State; e) requiring their vessels fishing on the high seas to carry the license, authorization or permit on board at all times and to produce it on demand for inspection by a duly authorized person. ii Establishment of a national record of fishing vessels entitled to fly their flags and authorized to fish in the ICCAT Convention Area, which should include vessels of other States authorized under charter agreements, and transmission of this information to ICCAT. iii Regulation of transshipment. iv Measures regarding the operation and control of chartering. v Requirements for recording and timely reporting of vessel position, catch of target and non target species, fishing effort and other relevant fisheries data including an estimate of discards, unless ICCAT stipulates otherwise. These data should be verified for certain fisheries by observer programs, where these programs have been adopted by the Commission. vi Implementation of a vessel monitoring system (VMS). vii Investigation of, follow-up to, and report on actions taken in response to an alleged violation by a vessel. 2. Obligations of the Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities The obligations of the Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities should include: i Provision to ICCAT, in the manner and at such regular intervals as may be required by ICCAT, of compliance reports and information concerning its fishing activities, including fishing area and fishing vessels, in order to facilitate the compilation of reli able fishing statistics (catch, effort, size samples, etc.), and the effective implementation of ICCAT’s compliance program. ii Compliance with all ICCAT conservation and management measures. 3. Compliance and enforcement The Contracting Parties, through the Commission, should establish an observation and inspection program to ensure compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures. The program may inter alia comprise the following elements: i High seas inspection. ii Procedures for an effective investigation of an alleged violation of ICCAT conservation and management measures, and for reporting to the Commission on the actions taken, including procedures for exchanging information. iii Provisions for appropriate action to be taken when inspections reveal serious violations as well as the expedient and transparent follow -up of such actions in order to uphold the Flag State’s responsibility within the intended program. iv Port inspections. 329 v Monitoring of landings and catches, including statistical follow-up for management purposes. vi Specific monitoring programs adopted by ICCAT, including boarding and inspection. vii Observer programs. 4. A program to promote compliance by vessels of non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities Further to existing measures, ICCAT should examine measures consistent with international law to deter activities of such vessels which undermine the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures. – Implementation of all the relevant elements of the FAO International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. – Prohibition of landings and transshipments of ICCAT species by vessels of non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities, sighted in the ICCAT Convention Area, that do not comply with the relevant ICCAT conservation and management measures. 330 03-12 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF CONTRACTING PARTIES AND COOPERATING NON-CONTRACTING PARTIES, ENTITIES, OR FISHING ENTITIES IN RELATION TO THEIR VESSELS FISHING IN THE ICCAT CONVENTION AREA (Entry into force: June 19, 2004) IN ACCORDANCE WITH the Needs and Principles set forth in the General Outline of Integrated Monitoring Measures Adopted by ICCAT, adopted by the Commission in 2002 to ensure effective monitoring measures; CONSIDERING the deliberations of the ICCAT Working Group to Develop Integrated Monitoring Measures held in Madeira from 26 to 28 May 2003; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1.

Each flag CPC shall establish and maintain an up -to-date record of fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag and authorized to fish species managed by ICCAT in the Convention area, which should include vessels of other flags authorized under charter agreements. 3. Each flag CPC shall ensure that its fishing vessels authorized to fish species managed by ICCAT in the Convention area, as well as their fishing gears, are marked in such a way that they can be readily identified in accordance with generally accepted stan dards such as the FAO standard specification for the marking and the identification of fishing vessels. 331 03-13 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT CONCERNING THE RECORDING OF CATCH BY FISHING VESSELS IN THE ICCAT CONVENTION AREA (Entry into force: June 19, 2004) IN ACCORDANCE WITH the Needs and Principles set forth in the General Outline of Integrated Monitoring Measures Adopted by ICCAT, adopted by the Commission in 2002 to ensure effective monitoring measures; CONSIDERING the deliberations of the ICCAT Working Group to Develop Integrated Monitoring Measures held in Madeira from 26 to 28 May 2003; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Each flag Contracting Party, Cooperating non -Contracting Party, Entity or Fishing Entity shall ensure that all fishing vessels flying its flag and authorized to fish species managed by ICCAT in the Convention area be subject to a data recording system. All commercial fishing vessels over 24 m length overall shall keep a bound or electronic logbook recording the information required in the ICCAT Field Manual for Statistics and Sampling. In the case of sport fishing vessels, other comparable data-collection systems shall be acceptable. 332 03-16 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO ADOPT ADDITONAL MEASURES AGAINST ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED (IUU) FISHING (Entry into force: June 19, 2004) MINDFUL of the need to improve the control and management of quotas and catch limits fixed by ICCAT, CONCERNED by the fact that the activities of IUU fishing in the ICCAT Convention area continue, and that these activities undermine the effectiveness of the ICCAT conservation and management measures, NOTING that certain vessels catch, land, place in cages for farming, market and/or transship tuna and tuna-like species when their flag State has no quota, catch limit or effort allocation in accordance with ICCAT conservation and management measures, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Consistent with their rights and obligations under international law, Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereafter referred to as CPCs) take the necessary measures to prohibit landings from fishing ve ssels, placing in cages for farming and/or the transshipment within their jurisdiction of tunas or tuna-like species caught by IUU fishing activities. 333 04-12 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO ADOPT MEASURES CONCERNING SPORT AND RECREATIONAL FISHING ACTIVITIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA (Entry into force: June 13, 2005) TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the need to regulate sport and recreational fishing activities to ensure that these activities do not undermine sustainable exploitation of the stocks, notably the bluefin tuna stock, in the Mediterranean Sea, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE ATLANTIC TUNA (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties, Entities, and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereafter named CPCs) shall take the measures necessary to forbid the use within the framework of sport and recreational fishing of towed nets, encircling nets, seine sliding, dredgers, gill nets, trammel net and longline to fish for tuna and tuna-like species, notably bluefin tuna, in the Mediterranean Sea. 2. The CPCs shall ensure that catches of tuna and tuna -like species carried out in the Mediterranean Sea from sport and recreational fishing are not marketed. 3. The CPCs shall take the necessary measures so that catch data from sport and recreational fishing are collected and transmitted to the SCRS. 334 05-07 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT CONCERNING THE CHANGE IN THE REGISTRY AND FLAGGING OF VESSELS (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: December 14, 2005) RECALLING that ICCAT has adopted an extensive variety of conservation and management measures aimed at achieving the objective of the Convention of maximum sustainable catches of tunas and tuna -like species in the Convention area, CONCERNED that, in spite of the adoption of these measures, large longliners that carry out illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities in the Convention area resort to constant changes in vessel names, registration and flags as new stratagems to undermine the effectiveness of the ICCAT conservation and management measures, CONVINCED of the need to adopt new measures that result in halting the use of these practices to evade the ICCAT conservation and management measures, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. As a prior condition for the registration or flagging of vessels, the Contracting and non -Contracting Parties should require the presentation of a Certificate of Deletion from the previous Registry or flag or any other proof of consent to the transfer of the ship, issued by the previous Contracting Party or non- Contracting Party State. 2. Prior to the registry of any fishing vessel, the CPC should investigate the history of compliance of the subject vessel in ICCAT and other regional management organizations, in order to determine if such vessel is on the negative lists and/or is currently registered in the sanctioned CPCs or non-Contracting Parties. 335 05-08 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ON CIRCLE HOOKS (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: December 14, 2005) RECOGNIZING that ICCAT Parties should already be reporting data on incidentally caught sea turtles to the SCRS; IN SUPPORT OF the 2004 Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Technical Consultation on Sea Turtles Conservation and Fisheries and the Guidelines to Reduce Sea Turtle Mortality in Fishing Operations, which were adopted by the Committee on Fisheries (COFI) in March 2005; RECALLING that the 2003 Resolution by ICCAT on Sea Turtles [Res. 03 -11] encourages “technical measures to reduce the incidental catch of turtles” and resolves to “support efforts by FAO to address the conservation and management of sea turtles, through a holistic approach”; NOTING that recent international scientific studies on circle hooks show a statistically significant decrease in sea turtle by -catch when such hooks are used in pelagic longline fishing, but that studies and trials continue in different geographic areas; FURTHER NOTING that scientific studies indicate that, with the use of circle hooks, the hooking location can lead to a decrease in post-release mortality of incidentally caught species; CONSIDERING that the United Nations Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks calls on nations to take ecosystem considerations into account and that many countries, including Contracting Parties, are moving to incorporate ecosystem considerations into fisheries management; and ALSO RECALLING that both blue marlin and white marlin are currently under a rebuilding plan and the use of circle hooks has been experimentally shown to significantly reduce their post-release mortality; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS RESOLVES THAT: 1. All Contracting Parties, Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities, and Fishing Entities (CPCs) are encouraged to undertake research trials of appropriate-size circle hooks in commercial pelagic longline fisheries. 2. CPCs should also encourage research and trials on the use of circle hooks in recreational and artisanal fisheries. 3. CPCs are encouraged to exchange ideas regarding fishing methods and technological gear changes that improve the safe handling and release of incidentally caught species including, but not limited to, the use of de-hookers, line cutters, and scoop nets. 4. When feasible and appropriate, SCRS should present the Commission with an assessment of the impact of circle hooks on the dead discard levels in ICCAT pelagic longline fisheries. 336 06-13 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT CONCERNING TRADE MEASURES (Entry into force: June 13, 2007) NOTING that the objective of ICCAT is to maintain the populations of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic at levels which will permit harvesting at maximum sustainable yield; CONSIDERING the need for action to ensure the effectiveness of the ICCAT objectives; CONSIDERING the obligation of all Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as CPCs) to respect the ICCAT conservation and management measures; AWARE of the necessity for sustained efforts by CPCs to ensure the enforcement of ICCAT’s conservation and management measures, and the need to encourage non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereinafter referred to as NCPs) to abide by these measures; NOTING that trade restrictive measures should be implemented only as a last resort, where other measures have proven unsuccessful to prevent, deter and eliminate any act or omission that diminishes the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures; ALSO NOTING that trade restrictive measures should be adopted and implemented in accordance with international law, including principles, rights and obligations established in World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements, and be implemented in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. CPCs that import tuna and tuna -like fish and/or fish products or in whose ports those products are landed, shall identify such products, collect and examine the relevant import, landing or associated data on such products, in order to submit the relevant information in a timely manner to the ICCAT Secretariat for distribution to the other CPCs to collect any additional element in order that the Commission can identify each year: a) vessels that caught and produced such tuna or tuna-like species products, i) name ii) flag iii) name and address of owners iv) registration number b) farming facilities i) name ii) location iii) name and address of owners iv) registration number c) species (of tuna and tuna-like species) of the products, d) areas of catch (Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, or other area), e) product weight by product type, f) points of export 337 2. a) The Commission, through the Conservation and Management Measures Compliance Committee (hereinafter Compliance Committee) or the Permanent Working Group for the Improvement of ICCAT Statistics and Conservation Measures (hereinafter PWG), shall identify each year: i) The CPCs that have failed to discharge their obligations under the ICCAT Convention in respect of ICCAT conservation and management measures, in particular, by not taking measures or exercising effective control to ensure compliance with ICCAT conservatio n and management measures by the vessels flying their flag, or farming facilities subject to their jurisdiction; and/or ii) The NCPs that have failed to discharge their obligations under international law to co-operate with ICCAT in the conservation and management of tuna and tuna -like species, in particular, by not taking measures or exercising effective control to ensure that their vessels or their farming facilities do not engage in any activity that undermines the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures. b) These identifications should be based on a review of all information provided in accordance with paragraph 1 or, as appropriate, any other relevant information, such as: the catch data compiled by the Commission; trade information on these species obtaine d from national statistics; the ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation Programme, the ICCAT Bigeye Tuna and Swordfish Statistical Document Programmes; the list of the IUU vessels adopted by ICCAT, as well as any other relevant information. c) In deciding whether to make identification, the Compliance Committee or the PWG should consider all relevant matters including the history, and the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the act or omission that may have diminished the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures. 3. The Commission should request CPCs and NCPs concerned to rectify the act or omission identified under paragraph 2 so as not to diminish the effectiveness of the ICCAT conservation and management measures. The Commission should notify identified CPCs and NCPs of the following: a) the reason(s) for the identification with all available supporting evidence; b) the opportunity to respond to the Commission in writing at least 30 days prior to the annual meeting of the Commission with regard to the identification decision and other relevant information, for example, evidence refuting the identification or, where a ppropriate, a plan of action for improvement and the steps they have taken to rectify the situation; and c) in the case of a NCP, an invitation to participate as an observer at the annual meeting where the issue will be considered. 4. CPCs are encouraged jointly and individually to request the CPC/NCPs concerned to rectify the act or omission identified under paragraph 2 so as not to diminish the effectiveness of the ICCAT conservation and management measures. 5. The Executive Secretary should, by more than one means of communication, within 10 working days following the approval of the report of the Compliance Committee or the PWG, transmit the Commission's request to the identified CPC or NCP. The Executive Secr etary should seek to obtain confirmation from the CPC or the NCP that it received the notification. 6. The Compliance Committee or the PWG should evaluate the response of the CPCs or NCPs, together with any new information, and propose to the Commission to decide upon one of the following actions: a) the revocation of the identification; b) the continuation of the identification status of the CPC or NCP; or c) the adoption of non-discriminatory trade restrictive measures. 338 Absence of response from the CPCs/NCPs concerned within the time limit shall not prevent action from the Commission. In the case of CPCs, actions such as the reduction of existing quotas or catch limits should be implemented to the extent possible before consideration is given to the application of trade restrictive measures. Trade measures should be considered only wher e such actions either have proven unsuccessful or would not be effective. 7. If the Commission decides upon the action described in paragraph 6 c), it should recommend to the Contracting Parties pursuant to Article VIII of the Convention to take non -discriminatory trade restrictive measures, consistent with their international obl igations. The Commission shall notify the CPCs and NCPs concerned of the decision and the underlying reasons in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph 5. 8. CPCs shall notify the Commission of any measures that they have taken for the implementation of the non discriminatory trade restrictive measures adopted in accordance with paragraph 7. 9. In order for the Commission to recommend the lifting of trade restrictive measures, the Compliance Committee or the PWG shall review each year all trade restrictive measures adopted in accordance with paragraph 7. Should this review show that the situation has been rectified, the Compliance Committee or PWG shall recommend to the Commission the lifting of the non -discriminatory trade restrictive measures. Such decisions should also take into consideration whether the CPCs and/or NCPs concerned have taken concrete measures capable of achieving lasting improvement of the situation. 10. Where exceptional circumstances so warrant or where available information clearly shows that, despite the lifting of trade -restrictive measures, the CPC or NCP concerned continues to diminish the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures , the Commission may immediately decide on action including, as appropriate, the imposition of trade-restrictive measures in accordance with paragraph 7. Before making such a decision, the Commission shall request the CPC or NCP concerned to discontinue its wrongful conduct and shall provide the CPC or NCP with a reasonable opportunity to respond. 11. The Commission shall establish annually a list of CPCs and NCPs that have been subject to a trade - restrictive measure pursuant to paragraph 7 and, with respect to NCPs, are considered as non - Cooperating non-Contracting Parties to ICCAT. 12. The Resolution by ICCAT Concerning Trade Measures [Res. 03 -15] is repealed and replaced by the present Recommendation. For the purposes of this paragraph, CPCs and NCPs that are under sanction pursuant to Resolution 03 -15 are deemed to be sanctioned under the present Recommendation, provided that this will not result in any greater level of sanction than that already imposed. 339 08-09 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR THE REVIEW AND REPORTING OF COMPLIANCE INFORMATION (Entry into force: June 17, 2009) RECOGNIZING the international obligations regarding flag state responsibilities to ensure compliance with management measures and to immediately and fully investigate allegations of non-compliance, ACKNOWLEDGING that effective monitoring and control is required to achieve compliance with agreed upon ICCAT management measures so that the goals of such management measures have a chance of being achievable, ACKNOWLEDGING that the Commission has historically suffered from a lack of information as well as data deficiencies thus resulting in an inability to identify relevant instances of non -compliance with management measures, NOTING that, in a responsible, open, transparent and non-discriminatory manner, the Commission should be made aware of any and all available information that may be relevant to the work of the Commission in identifying and holding accountable instances of non -compliance with management measures, FURTHER NOTING ICCAT’s Guidelines for the Dissemination of Information Submitted by Contracting Parties, Cooperating Non-Contracting Parties, Entities and Fishing Entities, RECOGNIZING that, the Compliance Officer position is authorized and financed by the members of the Commission to assist the Secretariat specifically with the Commission’s ongoing work to strengthen ICCAT; particularly in regards to overseeing, coordinating, and execut ing actions on compliance matters of relevance to the Commission, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties, Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) should submit to the Secretariat documented information that indicates possible non -compliance with ICCAT Conservation and Management Measures at least 120 days before the annual meeting. 2. The Executive Secretary shall transmit this information to the CPCs involved in any reports of non - compliance at least 90 days before the annual meeting. 3. CPCs shall, consistent with domestic laws, provide the Executive Secretary with the findings of any investigation taken in relation to the allegations of non -compliance and any actions taken to address compliance concerns at least 30 days before the annual meeting. If such investigation is ongoing, CPCs shall advise the Executive Secretary of the expected length of the investigation and provide periodic updates in their progress until completed. 4. The Executive Secretary shall circulate to all CPCs, at least two weeks in advance of the annual meeting a summary report of information received, including responses by CPCs, which shall be considered by the Compliance Committee and the PWG, as appropriat e in a responsible, open, transparent and non - discriminatory manner. 5. Non-governmental organizations may submit reports on non-compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures to the Secretariat at least 120 days before the annual meeting for circulation to the CPCs. Organizations submitting reports may request to present such reports to the Compliance Committee and the Permanent Working Group. In adopting the Agendas for meetings of the respective bodies CPCs shall determine if such presentations can be accommodated. 340 08-10 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO HARMONIZE THE MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH OF THE VESSELS AUTHORIZED TO FISH IN THE AREA OF THE CONVENTION (Entry into force: June 17, 2009) NOTING that several ICCAT recommendations and resolutions refer to the length of the vessels, ALSO NOTING that there exist different definitions of the length of the vessels in ICCAT recommendations and resolutions, WHEREAS it would be advisable to use identical rules for determining the length of the vessels, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: The length of a vessel referred in the recommendations and the resolutions adopted by ICCAT corresponds to the length overall, defined as the distance measured in a straight line between the foremost point of the bow and the aftermost point of the stern. 341 09-09 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT AMENDING THREE RECOMMENDATIONS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE 2009 RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ICCAT RECORD OF VESSELS 20 METERS IN LENGTH OVERALL OR GREATER AUTHORIZED TO OPERATE IN THE CONVENTION AREA (Entry into force: June 1, 2010) RECOGNISING that the 2009 Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels 20 Meters in Length Overall or Greater Authorized to Operate in the Convention Area [Rec. 09-08] replaces the 2002 Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels Over 24 Meters Authorized to Operate in the Convention Area [Rec. 02-225F 1]; NOTING three previously adopted Recommendations that make reference to Recommendation 02-22, in some cases adopting the conditions and procedures established in that Recommendation mutatis mutandis, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. References to the 2002 “ Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels Over 24 Meters Authorized to Operate in the Convention Area ” [Rec. 02 -22] be replaced by “Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Establishment of an ICCAT Record of Vessels 20 Meters in Length Overall or Greater Authorized to Operate in the Convention Area” in the following provisions: i) Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Amendment of the Forms of the ICCAT Bluefin/Bigeye/Swordfish Statistical Documents [Rec. 03-19], in the first paragraph of the preamble; ii) Recommendation Amending the Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-annual Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean [Rec. 08-05F 2], in paragraph 56 and 58. iii) Recommendation by ICCAT Amending Ten Recommendations and Three Resolutions [Rec. 08-113] in Paragraph 2 (iii) and Paragraph 5. 2.

By 15 September of each year, Contracting Parties and Cooperating Non -Contracting Parties, Entities, and Fishing Entities (CPCs) shall complete and submit the following to ICCAT using Commission - approved tables and forms provided by the Secretariat: − an "ICCAT Compliance Reporting Table" covering each of its applicable fisheries, and − a form for each stock or species, as appropriate, showing how adjusted quotas or catch limits were calculated taking into account ICCAT’s rules on under and overharvests. The Compliance Reporting Table shall cover the current reporting year and any revisions of previous years' data, which should be highlighted for ease of reference. The table format shall include, inter alia, current catches, balance, adjusted quotas/catch limits, and, where applicable, minimum size data. CPCs shall submit their compliance reporting table and forms for the application of underharvests/overharvests electronically in the format provided by the Secretariat. 2. Upon submission of the ICCAT Compliance Reporting Tables to the Commission, the Secretariat in consultation with the Compliance Committee Chairman shall prepare and distribute to CPCs a “Compliance Annex.” The Annex will reflect: (1) all catch limits and minimum sizes/tolerances to which each CPC is subject; (2) each CPC’s catch statistics submitted to the SCRS for the current reporting year, and any revisions to previous years' data; (3) any underharvests or overharvests; (4) all catch limit reductions that each Party must take pursuant to applicable rules and any catch limit increases a CPC may choose to take due to underharvest; and (5) the dates by when such reductions or increases will be taken. In the Compliance Annex, the Secretariat shall also not e where compliance table submissions by CPCs indicate actions that may be inconsistent with ICCAT recommendations for consideration by the Compliance Committee. 3. At each annual meeting, the Compliance Committee shall review and adjust, as necessary, the Compliance Annex to ensure it reflects the proper application of ICCAT’s compliance recommendations. In support of this review, each CPC shall report on the inform ation presented in its ICCAT Compliance Reporting Table, including a detailed explanation of any overharvest of a catch limit and/or minimum size tolerance level, the actions already taken, or to be taken, to prevent further overharvest, and the dates by which such actions will be taken. CPCs shall also report any changes to the compliance information provided in previous years and explain, in detail, any changes to their Compliance Reporting Table made after the 15 September deadline 8F 1. If a CPC’s compliance data differs substantially from relevant statistics reported to SCRS, the Committee shall seek an explanation for the difference, where necessary and appropriate. 4. At each annual meeting, the Compliance Committee will present the results of its deliberations on the application of ICCAT’s compliance recommendations, as reflected in a final Compliance Annex, for endorsement, in whole or in part, by the Commission. The Compliance Annex will be appended to the meeting report. 5. This Recommendation replaces Recommendation by ICCAT on Application of Three Compliance Recommendations (98-14) in its entirety. 1 This deadline was changed to 15 August through Rec. 18-07. 343 11-13 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON THE PRINCIPLES OF DECISION MAKING FOR ICCAT CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES (Entry into force: June 7, 2012) RECALLING the Recommended Course of Actions from the first Global Summit of Tuna RFMOs in Kobe, Japan, noted that management decisions should be based upon scientific advice and consistent with the precautionary approach; NOTING that participants of the first Global Summit of Tuna RFMOs in 2007 in Kobe, Japan agreed that stock assessment results be presented in a standardized “four quadrant, red -yellow-green” format that is now referred to as the “Kobe Plot,” which is widely embraced as a practical, user-friendly method to present stock status information; FURTHER NOTING that, at the Second Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs in June 2009 in San Sebastian, Spain, a “Strategy Matrix” was adopted to provide fisheries managers with the statistical probability of meeting management targets, including ending overfishing and rebuildi ng overfished stocks, in a standardized manner as a result of potential management actions; ACKNOWLEDGING that the Strategy Matrix is a harmonized format for RFMO science bodies to convey advice, and that this format for presenting stock assessment results facilitates the application of the precautionary approach by providing Commissions with the basis to eval uate and adopt management options at various levels of probability of success; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: To support the achievement of the ICCAT Convention objective, the following principles, based on the status of stocks as represented by the Kobe Plot, shall guide the development of management measures for ICCAT- managed stocks: 1. For stocks that are not overfished and not subject to overfishing (i.e., stocks in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot), management measures shall be designed to result in a high probability of maintaining the stock within this quadrant. 2. For stocks that are not overfished, but are subject to overfishing, (i.e., stocks in the upper right yellow quadrant of the Kobe plot), the Commission shall immediately adopt management measures, taking into account, inter alia, the biology of the stock and SCRS advice, designed to result in a high probability of ending overfishing in as short a period as possible. 3. For stocks that are overfished and subject to overfishing (i.e., stocks in the red quadrant of the Kobe plot), the Commission shall immediately adopt management measures, taking into account, inter alia, the biology of the stock and SCRS advice, designed to result in a high probability of ending overfishing in as short a period as possible. In addition, the Commission shall adopt a plan to rebuild these stocks taking into account, inter alia, the biology of the stock and SCRS advice. 4. For stocks that are overfished and not subject to overfishing (i.e. stocks in the lower left yellow quadrant of the Kobe plot), the Commission shall adopt management measures designed to rebuild these stocks in as short a period as possible, taking into account, inter alia, the biology of the stock and SCRS advice. 344 11-14 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT TO STANDARDIZE THE PRESENTATION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN THE SCRS ANNUAL REPORT AND IN WORKING GROUP DETAILED REPORTS (Entry into force: December 7, 2011) NOTING that the presentation of scientific information in the Standing Committee for Research and Statistics (SCRS) annual report to the Commission can vary by stock; STRESSING the importance of standardizing the presentation of scientific information to facilitate an easier appropriation and utilization by the Commission; RECALLING recommendations of the Kobe II Workshop of Experts to Share Best Practices on the Provision of Scientific Advice and of the Kobe III recommendations, in particular on development on research activities to better quantify the uncertainty and understand how this uncertainty is reflected in the risk assessment inherent in the Kobe II strategy matrix; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS RESOLVES AS FOLLOWS: 1. In support of the SCRS scientific advice, the Executive Summaries within the SCRS annual report which present the results of the stock assessment results should include, when possible: i) A statement characterizing the robustness of methods applied to assess stock status and to develop the scientific advice. This statement should focus on modeling approaches and on assumptions. ii) Three Kobe matrices, in accordance with the format set out in Annex Table 2: a) A Kobe II strategy matrix indicating the probability of B>B MSY for different levels of catch across multiple years. b) A Kobe II strategy matrix indicating the probability of F<F MSY for different levels of catch across multiple years. c) A Kobe II strategy matrix indicating the probability of B>BMSY and F<FMSY for different levels of catch across multiple years. d) Kobe II strategy matrices to be prepared by the SCRS should highlight in a similar format as shown in Annex Table 2 a progression of probabilities over 50 % and in the range of 50 - 59 %, 60-69 %, 70-79 %, 80-89 % and ≥ 90 %. e) When the Commission agrees on acceptable probability levels on a stock by stock basis and communicates them to the SCRS, the SCRS should prepare and include, in the annual report, the Kobe II strategy matrices using color coding corresponding to these thresholds. iii) A statement concerning the reliability of long-term projections period. iv) A Kobe plot chart showing: a) Management reference points expressed as FCURRENT on FMSY (or a proxy) and as BCURRENT on BMSY (or a proxy); b) The estimated uncertainty around current stock status estimates; c) The stock status trajectory. in accordance with the format set out in Annex Figure 1. v) A pie chart summarizing the stock status showing the proportion of model outputs that are within the green quadrant of the Kobe plot chart (not overfished, no overfishing), the yellow quadrant (overfished or overfishing), and the red quadrant (overfished and overfishing), in accordance with the format set out in Annex Figure 2. 345 vi) An indication of the modeling approaches used by the SCRS to conduct the stock assessment shall be included in the caption and in the corresponding text accompanying the introduction of the matrices and the charts. vii) Statements, where needed, reflecting the different opinions expressed regarding the SCRS scientific advice during the endorsement process. 2. The Kobe plot chart described in paragraph 1 should reflect the uncertainties on the estimates of the relative Biomass (BCURRENT on BMSY or its proxy) and of the relative fishing mortality (F CURRENT on FMSY or its proxy), provided that statistical methods to do so have been agreed upon by SCRS and that sufficient data exist to do so. 3. The SCRS should review recommendations and templates for the Kobe II strategy matrices, plot and pie charts as laid down in this resolution and should advise the Commission on possible improvements. 4. If the Commission adopts alternative reference points, such as limit reference points associated to the precautionary approach, the SCRS should also provide in its annual report versions of the elements described in paragraphs 1 and 2 calculated with respe ct to these alternative reference points and following the format specified in the same paragraphs. 5. The SCRS should indicate in its annual report those cases where the modeling approaches used during the assessment and/or data limitation did not allow for the preparation of the elements mentioned above. 6. The Kobe II strategy matrices are intended to reflect the scientists understanding of the uncertainties associated with their model estimates. Therefore, where models and/or data are insufficient to quantify those uncertainties, the SCRS should consider al ternative means of representing them in ways that are useful to the Commission. 7. When, due to data limitations, the SCRS is unable to develop Kobe II strategy matrices and associated charts or other estimates of current status relative to benchmarks, the SCRS should develop its scientific advice on fisheries indicators in the context o f Harvest Control Rules, if previously agreed upon by the Commission. 8. The SCRS should also include in its annual report any other tables and/or graphics that it considers useful to provide advice to the Commission. 9. The Commission encourages the SCRS to also include in the detailed reports, where possible, the following additional elements: i) A scoring table addressing data completeness and quality with the format set out in Annex Table 1; ii) Information on the by -catches of the different fleet segments and fisheries, as well as other ecosystems considerations. 346 Annex Possible Templates for Kobe II Strategy Matrices, Plot and Pie Charts Table 1.

NOTING, however, that the standardization of information included in the SCRS reports with respect to the quality and reliability of input data and projections of stock status can be further enhanced; RECALLING the recommendation of the Kobe II Workshop of Experts to Share Best Practices on the Provision of Scientific Advice that the Executive Summaries of scientific reports should be standardized to the extent possible; RECALLING that the Kobe III Workshop of Experts on Science recognized that substantial uncertainties still remain in the assessments and recommended that the Scientific Committees and Bodies of the t -RFMOs develop research activities to better quantify the whole un certainty and understand how uncertainty is reflected in the risk assessment inherent in the Kobe II Strategy Matrix; CONSIDERING the utility of distinguishing, where possible, between the inherent variability in natural system (i.e. life history parameters) which is unavoidable, and the uncertainty related to the quality of the state of knowledge of the system and of the fishery data, which could potentially be reduced through improvements to the available data and/or the models applied; FURTHER NOTING that the SCRS, as part of its 2015 -2020 Strategic Plan for Science, will develop specific formats to provide scientific advice in line with the needs of the Commission. FINALLY STRESSING that the best way to tackle uncertainties related to fisheries data consists for CPCs in complying with their fundamental obligations of reporting basic catch and effort statistics, including reliable Task I and Task II data, in a due time to ensure their availability to the SCRS. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS RESOLVES AS FOLLOWS: 1. The SCRS should clearly identify sources of variability and uncertainty and clearly explain how this variability and uncertainty affect the stock assessment results and the interpretation of the Kobe II Strategy Matrices. 2. The SCRS should further standardize the presentation of information included in its reports. 3. Therefore, in addition to the minimum elements required by Resolution 11 -14, the SCRS may further score the quality of the fisheries data and related to the knowledge of the species (e.g. biological parameters, fishery distribution patterns historical data , selectivity) used as inputs to stock assessments. Qualitative scores on input data and assumptions may be detailed and should summarize the state of knowledge of the different inputs and report on: a) the quality, the reliability and, where relevant, the representativeness of input data and information, such as, but not limited to, (i) fisheries statistics and fisheries indicators (e.g. catch and effort, catch -at-size and catch -at-age matrices by sex an d, when applicable, fisheries dependent indices of abundance), (ii) biological information (e.g. growth parameters, natural mortality, maturity and fecundity, migrations patterns and stock structure, fisheries independent indices of abundance) and (iii) co mplementary information ( i.e. consistencies among available abundance indices, influence of the environmental factors on the dynamic of the stock, changes in fishing effort distribution, selectivity and fishing power, changes in target species), 357 b) limitations of the assessment models used with respect to the type and the quality of the input data, c) potential biases in the assessment results associated with uncertainties of the input data. 4. For the purpose of paragraphs 2 and 3, the SCRS may consider a specific table or any other alternate format to be included in its annual report in association to the Kobe plot in order to summarize the information required in this resolution. 5. In cases where the SCRS utilizes different modeling approaches and/or scenarios ( i.e., sensitivity runs or alternative hypotheses) to characterize uncertainty in stock assessments, the SCRS should clearly identify what it considers as the most defensible or the most likely scenario (i.e., 'base case') and provide the rationale for its decision. In cases where these different approaches and/or scenarios would finally be considered as equally plausible, this model or structural uncertainty should be accounted for in the calculation of the stock assessment parameters. 358 14-07 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON ACCESS AGREEMENTS (Entry into force 3 June 2015) MINDFUL of the data reporting requirements for all CPCs and the importance of complete statistical reporting to the work of SCRS and the Commission; MINDFUL of the need to ensure transparency among CPCs in respect of conditions for accessing the waters of coastal States, in particular to facilitate joint efforts to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT on Vessel Chartering [Rec. 02-21] that establishes reporting and other requirements for chartering arrangements; RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Duties of Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities in Relation to their Vessels in the ICCAT Convention Area [Rec. 03-12], which requires CPCs to ensure that their vessels do not conduct unauthorized fishing within areas under the national jurisdiction of other States, through appropriate cooperation with coastal States concerned, and other relevant means available to the flag CPC; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities, and Fishing Entities (CPCs) that allow foreign-flagged vessels to fish in waters under their jurisdiction for species managed by ICCAT , and CPCs whose vessels fish in waters under the j urisdiction of another CPC or non -Contracting party (NCP) for species managed by ICCAT pursuant to an agreement, shall, individually or jointly, notify the Commission prior to beginning fishing activities of the existence of such agreements and provide to the Commission information concerning these agreements, including: − The CPCs, NCPs, or other entities involved in the agreement; − The time period or periods covered by the agreement; − The number of vessels and gear types authorized; − The stock or species authorized for harvest, including any applicable catch limits; − The CPC’s quota or catch limit to which the catch will be applied; − Monitoring, control, and surveillance measures required by the flag CPC and coastal State involved with, for the coastal State, a particular specification of: i) the National authority (contact coordinates) responsible for issuing fishing licenses or permits, ii) the National authority (contact coordinates) responsible for MCS activities. − Data reporting obligations stipulated in the agreement, including those between the parties involved, as well as those regarding information that must be provided to the Commission; − A copy of the written agreement. 2.

Consistent with ICCAT data reporting requirements, flag CPCs involved in the agreements specified in paragraph 1 shall ensure that all target and incidental catches made pursuant to these agreements are reported to the SCRS. 359 5. Flag CPCs and coastal CPCs involved in the agreements specified in paragraph 1 shall provide a summary of the activities carried out pursuant to each agreement, including all catches made pursuant to these agreements, in their annual report to the Commission. 6. In cases where coastal CPCs allow foreign -flagged vessels to fish in waters under their jurisdiction for species managed by ICCAT through a mechanism other than a CPC -to-CPC or CPC -to-NCP agreement, the coastal CPC shall be solely responsible for providing the information required by this Recommendation. Flag CPCs with vessels involved in such an agreement, however , shall endeavour to provide to the Commission relevant information regarding that agreement as indicated in paragraph 1. 7. The Secretariat shall develop a form for reporting the information specified in this Recommendation and annually compile CPC submissions into a report to be presented to the Commission for consideration at its Annual meeting. 8. This recommendation does not apply to chartering arrangements covered by the Recommendation by ICCAT on Vessel Chartering [Rec. 02-21]1 9. All information provided pursuant to this Recommendation shall be consistent with domestic confidentiality requirements. 10. The Recommendation by ICCAT on Access Agreements [Rec. 11-16] is replaced by this Recommendation. 1 This measure was replaced by Recommendation 13-14. 360 14-08 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO SUPPORT EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATION 12-07 BY ICCAT FOR AN ICCAT SCHEME FOR MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR INSPECTION IN PORT (Entry into force 3 June 2015) RECALLING the 2009 Agreement on Port State Measures to Combat Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing; FURTHER RECALLING Recommendation by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) for an ICCAT Scheme for Minimum Standards for Inspection in Port (12-07); HIGHLIGHTING, in particular, that Recommendation 12-07 requires Contracting Parties and Cooperating Non-Contracting Parties, Entities, and Fishing Entities (CPCs), either directly or through the ICCAT Secretariat, to provide assistance to developing CPCs in order to, among other things, (1) develop their capacity to support and strengthen the development and implementation of an effective system of port inspection; (2) facilitate their participation in meetings and/or training programs of relevant organizations that promote the effective development and implementation of such a system, and (3) assess the special requirements of developing CPCs concerning the implementation of Recommendation 12-07; RECOGNIZING that the Commission, through Resolution 03-21 and Recommendations 11-26 and 13-19, has established several funds to facilitate attendance at meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies, enhance the scientific capacity of developing state scientists, and improve data collection and quality assurance; ALSO RECOGNIZING that a fund has been established under Part VII of the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Seas of December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Hi ghly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA) to provide assistance to developing States Parties to the Agreement for a number of purposes, including to build capacity for activities in key areas such as monitoring, control and surveillance; NOTING that several Contracting Parties, on their own initiative, have been carrying out capacity building activities to assist developing coastal States in improving their management of ICCAT fisheries, including tools and approaches for collecting and assessin g data, conducting monitoring, control, and surveillance activities, and enhancing domestic legal frameworks; DESIRING to take further concrete steps in ICCAT to support the implementation of CPC capacity building responsibilities with regard to Recommendation 12-07 to ensure the program is as effective as possible in promoting compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNA (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. A special Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance Fund (MCSF) be established to support and strengthen the development and implementation of effective systems of port inspection by developing CPCs in order to meet or exceed the minimum standards set out in Recommendation by ICCAT for an ICCAT Scheme for Minimum Standards for Inspection in Port (12-07). 2. Funds from the MCSF shall be used to provide technical assistance to port inspectors and other relevant enforcement personnel from developing CPCs. Such technical assistance can include, among other things, conducting or arranging for in country training a ctivities and supporting the participation of relevant developing CPC personnel in training programs or exchanges offered by other CPCs or organizations that promote the effective development and implementation of port inspection systems, including monitoring, control and surveillance, enforcement and legal proceedings for infractions, and the resolution of disputes pursuant to Recommendation 12-07. 361 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, for participation in meetings of the Commission or its subsidiary bodies where port inspection issues may be discussed, developing CPCs should seek funding support through the Meeting Participation Fund established per ICCAT Re commendation 11 -26. Further, all eligible applicants for support through the MCSF should explore alternative avenues of funding available to developing CPCs, such as the UNSFA Part VII fund, prior to applying to the MCSF. The Secretariat will advise eligible applicants whether alternate ICCAT funding sources may be appropriate to support that CPC’s particular capacity building needs. 4. The MCSF shall be financed, at least initially, by ICCAT’s Working Capital Fund. The amount of Working Capital funds allocated to the MCSF shall be decided by the Commission. CPCs are encouraged to supplement the MCSF through voluntary contributions. The fund may also be supplemented from other sources as the Commission may identify. The Commission will identify a procedure for supplying funds to the MCSF in the future as needed. 5. The initial allocation to the MCSF will be determined based on an assessment of developing CPC needs. In that regard, developing CPCs interested in seeking assistance from the MCSF should provide a report to the Commission on their progress in implementing Recommendation 12 -07 and identify specific areas where training or other assistance is needed. 6. The ICCAT Secretariat will administer the MCSF in accordance with the same financial controls as apply to regular budget appropriations. 7. The ICCAT Executive Secretary shall: a) establish a process for notifying CPCs annually of the level of available funds in the MCSF; b) develop a timeline and describe the format for the submission of applications for assistance, circulate this information to the Commission for intersessional review and approval, and, once agreed, post it on the public portion of the ICCAT website. c) develop and circulate to the Commission for intersessional review and approval, a process and procedures for evaluating requests for assistance from the MCSF to determine the level and type of assistance to provide taking into account available resources, Commission priorities, and the need to ensure fair and balanced access to the fund; d) notify the Commission and the requesting developing CPC of the details of the assistance to be provided without delay; and e) submit an annual report to the Commission on the status of the MCSF, including a financial statement of contributions to and disbursements from the fund and a summary of all assistance provided. 8. CPCs with the ability to provide relevant technical assistance to developing CPCs are strongly encouraged to explore bilateral or other arrangements to provide such assistance. CPCs are also encouraged to consider ways they may be able to support any ICCAT -sponsored initiatives, such as by providing relevant experts to conduct trainings. 9. The Commission shall coordinate, where feasible and appropriate, its port inspection capacity building activities with such activities of other RFMOs, the FAO, and other relevant entities. 10. This recommendation will be evaluated and reviewed at the latest in 2017. 362 15-07 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF HARVEST CONTROL RULES AND OF MANAGEMENT STRATEGY EVALUATION (Entry into force 4 June 2016) RECALLING Recommendation by ICCAT on the Principles of Decision Making for ICCAT Conservation and Management Measures [Rec. 11-13] to support the achievement of the ICCAT Convention objective; NOTING that the 2010 ICCAT Working Group for Stock Assessment Methods held in April 2010 in Madrid (Spain) endorsed the definitions on reference points presented during the 1999 ad hoc Meeting of the ICCAT Working Group on Precautionary Approach held in Dublin in May 1999; ACKNOWLEDGING that the discussions held in the First Meeting of the ICCAT Working Group to Enhance Dialogue between Fisheries Scientists and Managers suggested that a dialogue of a general nature should continue on issues such as acceptable levels of risk, targets, limits and time horizons based on Rec. [11-13]; ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING that the Second Meeting of the ICCAT Working Group to Enhance Dialogue between Fisheries Scientists and Managers recommended to examine ways to further define the management framework building on Rec. [11 -13], in particular in relation to reference points , associated probabilities and timeframes; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that one of the main goals of the SCRS Science Strategic Plan 2015-2020 is to evaluate precautionary management reference points and robust harvest control rules (HCRs) through management strategy evaluations (MSE); THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. For the purposes of this Recommendation, the following working definitions apply: a) The management strategy evaluation (MSE) is an inclusive, interactive and iterative process for evaluating, inter alia, the performance of proposed harvest control rules and reference points in relation to management objectives, including the risk associated with not achieving those objectives; b) A limit is a conservation reference point based on a level of biomass (BLIM) that should be avoided considering that beyond such limits, the sustainability of the stock may be in danger; c) A target is a management objective based on a level of biomass (B TARGET) or a fishing mortality rate (FTARGET) that should be achieved and maintained; d) A threshold is a level of biomass (B THRESHOLD) reflecting the precautionary approach that triggers pre-agreed management actions to reduce the risk of breaching the limits. Thresholds should be set sufficiently far away from limits so that there is low probability that the limits will be exceeded; and e) Harvest Control Rules (HCRs) are decision rules that aim to achieve the target reference point and avoid the limit reference point by specifying pre -agreed management actions when B THRESHOLD, FTARGET or BLIM are breached. 2. The above definition should be considered by the SCRS during its process of revising the ICCAT glossary. Based on SCRS input, the Commission should revise the definitions, as appropriate. 363 3. As first steps of MSE implementation for a specific stock, the Commission shall provide guidance to the SCRS. Therefore, beginning in 2016 and consistent with priorities to be agreed by the Commission in light of the SCRS work program, the relevant ICCAT P anels will identify the following management inputs on a stock -by-stock basis, for, inter alia , northern albacore, bluefin tuna, North Atlantic swordfish, and tropical tunas: a) Management objectives, such as maximizing average catch, minimizing inter-annual fluctuations in TAC levels, returning or maintaining the stock in the green quadrant of the Kobe plot, etc., taking into account the requirements of Rec. [11-13]; b) Acceptable quantitative level(s) of probability of achieving and/or maintaining stocks in the green zone of the Kobe plot and avoiding limit reference points; and c) Timeframes for halting overfishing on a stock and/or rebuilding an overfished stock. 4. As the next steps in MSE implementation and taking into account the inputs mentioned above, as soon as feasible for stocks subject to assessment and where possible, the SCRS shall advise the Commission on options for limit, target and threshold reference points and associated HCRs. In 2016, the SCRS will start by evaluating candidate HCRs during the assessment process planned for the northern albacore stock and will provide the Commission with a 5-year schedule for the establishment of species-specific HCRs. 5. In light of SCRS advice and in establishing the HCR for a particular stock, the Commission shall then determine pre-agreed management actions that will be triggered to halt or reduce fishing mortality if limit or threshold reference points are breached. Wh en defining those actions, principles, included in Annex 1, might be taken into account by the Commission together with the requirements of Rec. [11- 13]. 6. The SCRS will be requested to continue developing appropriate MSE methods to test the robustness of alternative limit, target and threshold reference points, and associated HCRs in relation to the management objectives, probabilities and timeframes determined by the Commission. 364 Annex 1 When determining pre-agreed management actions associated to HCRs and reference points, Panels might refer to the following principles i) In the case where the stock biomass is assessed as being above BTHRESHOLD, but the fishing mortality is assessed as exceeding F TARGET, management actions shall be adopted to reduce the fishing mortality rate in as short a period as possible to FTARGET. ii) In the case where the stock biomass is assessed as being below B THRESHOLD, management actions shall be implemented to reduce the fishing mortality rate in as short a period as possible to the F specified in the HCR. iii) In the case where the stock biomass is assessed as being below BLIM, severe management actions shall be adopted immediately to reduce the fishing mortality rate, including, inter alia , the suspension of the fishery and the initiation of scientific monitoring. 365 15-08 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT AMENDING DEADLINES OF TWO ICCAT RECOMMENDATIONS (Entry into force 4 June 2016) RECOGNISING that the change in the form of certain reporting requirements adopted by the Commission in 2014 has resulted in multiple submissions being required of CPCs; DESIRING to reduce the burden of unnecessary reporting requirements; RECOGNISING that current deadlines for certain reporting requirements do not significantly affect the work of the Commission: THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Paragraph 56 of Recommendation by ICCAT Amending the Recommendation 13 -07 by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean [Rec. 14-04] shall be amended to read: 56.

Paragraph 4 of the Recommendation By ICCAT for Management Measures for Mediterranean Swordfish in the Framework of ICCAT [Rec. 13-04] shall be amended to read: 4. By 31 July each year CPCs shall submit to the ICCAT Secretariat the list of the special fishing permits delivered for the previous year. 3. Paragraph 14 of the Recommendation By ICCAT for Management Measures for Mediterranean Swordfish in the Framework of ICCAT [Rec. 13-04] shall be amended to read: 14. By 31 July each year, CPCs shall communicate specific information for the fishing vessels that were authorized to carry out pelagic longline fisheries and harpoons in the Mediterranean during the preceding year: a) Specific information on the fishing vessel: − Name of the vessel (if no name, the registry number without country initials should be indicated); − Registry number; − ICCAT list number. CPCs shall communicate this list electronically to the ICCAT Secretariat according to the format set out in the Guidelines for Submitting Data and Information Required by ICCAT. 366 b) Specific information related to fishing activities, based on sampling or for the whole fleet: − Fishing period(s) and total annual number of fishing days of the vessel, by target species and area; − Geographical areas, by ICCAT statistical rectangles, for the fishing activities carried out by the vessel, by target species and area; − Type of vessel, by target species and area; − Number of hooks used by the vessel, by target species and area; − Number of longline units used by the vessel, by target species and area; − Overall length of all longline units for the vessel, by target species and area. c) Specific data on the catches, in the smallest time -area possible: − Size and, if possible, age distributions of the catches; − Catches and catch composition per vessel; and − Fishing effort ( average fishing days per vessel, average number of hooks per vessel, average longline units per vessel, average overall length of longline per vessel). These data shall be provided to SCRS in the format required by ICCAT. 367 15-09 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ESTABLISHING GUIDELINES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATION 11-15 BY ICCAT ON PENALTIES APPLICABLE IN THE CASE OF NON-FULFILMENT OF REPORTING OBLIGATIONS (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 4 December 2015) RECALLING that the Commission considered draft guidelines to facilitate the application of Recommendation 11-15 in 2012; FURTHER RECALLING that the Commission, through its Compliance Committee, applied these draft guidelines on a trial basis in 2013 and 2014; RECOGNIZING the utility of the draft guidelines and agreeing that their application should continue; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. The Commission will follow the schedule and steps set forth below to guide application of paragraph 3 of Recommendation 11-15: Data review year (starting in 2013 and annually thereafter) Following the decision on retention prohibition 1. CPCs submit Task 1 data to the Secretariat in accordance with Commission requirements and SCRS procedures; 2. The Secretariat, in consultation with the SCRS, compiles and circulates a report to the COC and CPCs detailing data submission status by species or stock (e.g., complete, incomplete, or missing) for each CPC; 3. COC reviews the report and any other relevant information provided by the Secretariat, the SCRS, and CPCs. Based on this review, the COC identifies in its report those CPCs that did not submit required data (i.e., data are missing or incomplete) and notifies them that they are prohibited from retaining the concerned species/stock from the relevant fishery as of the following year unless and until the data are provided to the Secretariat. 4. COC also considers if any other actions consistent with Recommendations 05 -09 and/or 06-13 should be recommended. 1. CPCs with a finding of "missing" or "incomplete" data submissions cannot retain those species; 2. Such CPCs should seek to rectify the situation by sending the missing data to the Secretariat as soon as feasible; 3. In consultation, as necessary and appropriate, with the Chairs of the COC and the Commission, the Secretariat will review the new data submission in a timely manner to determine if it is complete. If the data appear to be complete, the Secretariat will pro mptly inform the CPC in question that it can resume retention of the concerned species/stock in the relevant fishery. 4. At the Annual Meeting following the intersessional provision of data and the decision to permit resumption of retention, the COC reviews this decision and, if it considers that data are still incomplete, the COC will again take the actions specified in the previous column, paragraphs 3 and 4. 368 2. To facilitate the reporting of zero catches as required under paragraph 3 of Recommendation 11 -15, the following process and procedures will apply: a) As part of the ST02 -T1NC electronic form used to report nominal catches, the Secretariat will include a matrix by stock and main ICCAT gear groups (see Annex for example reporting matrix), as recommended in the protocol developed by the SCRS. b) CPCs, as part of their Task I nominal catch data reporting, will complete the cells in the matrix with either a value of ‘one’ (1) to indicate where that CPC had catches (positive catch) for a particular stock/gear combination or a value of ‘zero’ (0) to i ndicate where that CPC had no catches (zero landings + zero discards) for a particular stock/gear combination. c) The ‘Catch attributes’ section of the electronic form ST02 -T1NC will only include reports of positive catches. d) In light of the terms of Recommendation 11 -15, consideration will be given to expanding the matrix in the future to include additional stocks/species under the competence of ICCAT as well as other stock/gear combinations, as appropriate. 369 Annex Example reporting matrix LL PS BB HL TP TW TR GN HP RR HS TL TN Species group Stock/MUnit LL PS BB HAND TRAP TRAW TROL GILL HARP RR HS TL TN ALB Thunnus alalunga ALB-N ALB-S ALB-M BFT Thunnus thynnus BFT-E BFT-W BET Thunnus obesus BET-A SKJ Katsuwonus pelamis SKJ-E SKJ-W YFT Thunnus albacares YFT-E YFT-W SWO Xiphias gladius SWO-N SWO-S SWO-M BUM Makaira nigricans BUM-N BUM-S WHM Tetrapturus albidus WHM-N WHM-S SAI Istiophorus albicans SAI-E SAI-W SPF Tetrapturus pfluegeri SPF-E SPF-W BON Sarda sarda (all) LTA Euthynnus alletteratus (all) KGM Scomberomorus cavalla (all) FRI Auxis thazard (all) SSM Scomberomorus maculatus (all) BRS Scomberomorus brasiliensis (all) BSH Prionace glauca BSH-N BSH-S POR Lamna nasus POR-N POR-S SMA Isurus oxyrinchus SMA-N SMA-S FAL Carcharhinus falciformis (all) SPK Sphyrna mokarran (all) SPL Sphyrna lewini (all) SPZ Sphyrna zygaena (all) OCS Carcharhinus longimanus (all) ALV Alopias vulpinus (all) BTH Alopias superciliosus (all) PTH Alopias pelagicus (all) Species (code /sci. name) Gear codes Gear grp codes T1 "zero" catch matrix Major temperate tunas Major tropical tunas Major tuna like sp.

Notwithstanding additional observer program requirements that may be in place or adopted by ICCAT in the future for specific fisheries or fishing activities, each Contracting Party and Cooperating non - Contracting Party, Entity, or Fishing Entity (CPC) shal l implement the following minimum standards and protocols with respect to their domestic scientific observer programs to ensure the collection and reporting of relevant scientific information from ICCAT fisheries. Qualifications of Observers 2. Without prejudice to any training or technical qualifications recommended by the SCRS, CPCs shall ensure that their observers have the following minimum qualifications to accomplish their tasks: a) sufficient knowledge and experience to identify ICCAT species and fishing gear configurations; b) the ability to observe and record accurately the information to be collected under the Program; c) the capability of performing the tasks set forth in paragraph 7 below; d) the ability to collect biological samples; and e) minimum and adequate training in safety and sea survival. 3. In addition, in order to ensure the integrity of their domestic observer program, CPCs shall ensure the observers: a) are not crew members of the vessel being observed; b) are not employees of the owner or beneficial owner of the fishing vessel being observed ; and c) do not have current financial or beneficial interests in the fisheries being observed. Observer Coverage 4. Each CPC shall ensure the following with respect to its domestic observer programs: a) A minimum of 5% observer coverage of fishing effort in each of the pelagic longline, purse seine, and, as defined in the ICCAT glossary, baitboat, traps, gillnet and trawl fisheries. The percentage coverage will be measured: i. for purse seine fisheries, in number of sets or trips; ii. for pelagic longline fisheries, in fishing days, number of sets, or trips; iii. for baitboat and trap fisheries, in fishing days; iv. for gillnet fisheries, in fishing hours or days; and v. for trawl fisheries, in fishing hauls or days. b) Notwithstanding paragraph a), for vessels less than 15 meters, where an extraordinary safety concern may exist that precludes deployment of an onboard observer, a CPC may employ an alternative scientific monitoring approach that will collect data equivalen t to that specified in this recommendation in a manner that ensures comparable coverage. In any such cases, the CPC wishing to avail itself of an alternative approach must present the details of the approach to the SCRS for evaluation. The SCRS will advise the Commission on the suitability of the alternative approach for carrying out the data collection obligations set forth in this Recommendation. Alternative approaches implemented pursuant to this provision shall be subject to the approval of the Commission at the annual meeting prior to implementation. 372 c) Representative temporal and spatial coverage of the operation of the fleet to ensure the collection of adequate and appropriate data as required under this Recommendation and any additional domestic CPC observer program requirements, taking into account characteristics of the fleets and fisheries; d) Data collection on pertinent aspects of the fishing operation, including catch, as detailed in paragraph 7. 5. CPCs may conclude bilateral arrangements whereby one CPC places its domestic observers on vessels flying the flag of another CPC, as long as all provisions of this Recommendation are complied with. 6. CPCs shall endeavour to ensure that observers alternate vessels between their assignments. Tasks of the Observer 7. CPCs shall require, inter alia, observers to: a) record and report upon the fishing activity of the observed vessel, which shall include at least the following: i. data collection, that includes quantifying total target catch, discards and by -catch (including sharks, sea turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds), estimating or measuring size composition as practicable, disposition status (i.e., retained, discarded dead, released alive), the collection of biological samples for life history studies (e.g., gonads, otoliths, spines, scales); ii. collect and report on all tags found; iii. fishing operation information, including: − location of catch by latitude and longitude; − fishing effort information (e.g., number of sets, number of hooks, etc.); − date of each fishing operation, including, as appropriate, the start and stop times of the fishing activity; − use of fish aggregating objects, including FADs; and − general condition of released animals related to survival rates (i.e. dead/alive, wounded, etc.). b) observe and record the use of by-catch mitigation measures and other relevant information; c) to the extent possible, observe and report environmental conditions (e.g., sea state, climate and hydrologic parameters, etc.). d) observe and report on FADs, in accordance with the ICCAT Observer program adopted under the multi-annual conservation and management programme for tropical tuna; and e) perform any other scientific tasks as recommended by SCRS and agreed by the Commission . Obligations of the Observer 8. CPCs shall ensure that the observer: a) does not interfere with the electronic equipment of the vessel; b) is familiar with the emergency procedures aboard the vessel, including the location of life rafts, fire extinguishers and first aid kits; c) communicates as needed with the Master on relevant observer issues and tasks; 373 d) does not hinder or interfere with the fishing activities and the normal operations of the vessel; e) participates in a debriefing session(s) with appropriate representatives of the scientific institute or the domestic authority responsible for implementing the observer program; Obligations of the Master 9. CPCs shall ensure that the Master of the vessel to which the observer is assigned: a) permits appropriate access to the vessel and its operations; b) allows the observer to carry out his/her responsibilities in an effective way, including by: i. providing appropriate access to the vessel's gear, documentation (including electronic and paper logbooks), and catch; ii. communicating at any time with appropriate representatives of the scientific institute or domestic authority; iii. ensuring appropriate access to electronics and other equipment pertinent to fishing, including but not limited to: − Satellite navigation equipment − Electronic means of communication; iv. ensuring that no one on board the observed vessel tampers with or destroys observer equipment or documentation; obstructs, interferes with, or otherwise acts in a manner that could unnecessarily prevent the observer from performing his/her duties; intimidates, harasses, or harms the observer in any way; or bribes or attempts to bribe the observer. c) provides accommodation to observers, including berthing, food and adequate sanitary and medical facilities, equal to those of officers; d) provides the observer adequate space on the bridge or pilot house to perform his/her tasks, as well as space on deck adequate for carrying out observer tasks; Duties of the CPCs 10.

Duties of the Executive Secretary 11. The Executive Secretary facilitates access by SCRS and the Commission to relevant data and information submitted pursuant to this recommendation; Duties of the SCRS 12. The SCRS shall: a) develop, as needed and appropriate, an observer working manual for voluntary use by CPCs in their domestic observer programs, that includes model data collection forms and standardized data collection procedures, taking into account observer manuals and re lated materials that may already exist through other sources, including CPCs, regional and sub -regional bodies, and other organizations; b) develop fisheries specific guidelines for electronic monitoring systems; c) provide the Commission with a summary of the scientific data and information collected and reported pursuant to this recommendation and any relevant associated findings; d) make recommendations, as necessary and appropriate, on how to improve the effectiveness of scientific observer programs in order to meet the data needs of the Commission, including possible revisions to this Recommendation and/or with respect to implement ation of these minimum standards and protocols by CPCs. Electronic Monitoring Systems 13. Where they have been determined by SCRS to be effective in a particular fishery, electronic monitoring systems may be installed on board fishing vessels to complement or, pending SCRS advice and a Commission decision, to replace the human observer on board. 14. CPCs should consider any applicable guidelines that are endorsed by SCRS on the use of electronic monitoring systems. 15. CPCs are encouraged to report to the SCRS their experiences in the use of electronic monitoring systems in their ICCAT fisheries to complement human observer programs. CPCs who have not yet implemented such systems are encouraged to explore their use and report their findings to the SCRS. 375 Support to Developing States 16. Developing States shall report to the Commission on their special requirements in the implementation of the provisions of this Recommendation. The Commission shall take due regard of these special requirements. 17. Available ICCAT funds will be used to support the implementation of scientific observer programs in developing States, notably the training of observers. Final provisions 18. The Commission shall review this Recommendation no later than its 2019 annual meeting and consider revising it, in particular, in the light of information provided by CPCs and of SCRS recommendations. 19. Recommendation [10-10] is repealed and replaced by this Recommendation. 376 16-17 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ESTABLISHING AN ICCAT SCHEDULE OF ACTIONS TO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE AND COOPERATION WITH ICCAT MEASURES (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 12 December 2016) RECOGNIZING that compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures is critical to the success of the Commission; RECALLING the 2011 Commission adoption of Recommendation 11 -24, which amended the mandate and Terms of Reference of the Compliance Committee (COC) and required the COC to develop and make recommendations to the Commission to address issues of non-compliance or lack of cooperation with ICCAT conservation and management measures; RECOGNIZING that non -compliance should be addressed in a concrete, and transparent, non - discriminatory way, taking into account the need to remain flexible to address the unique circumstances of individual CPCs; FURTHER RECOGNIZING that not all non -compliance is of the same level of severity and impact on the effectiveness of ICCAT’s conservation and management measures or the work of the Commission; and COGNIZANT of the need to assist in providing a consistent, fair, and transparent approach for considering and applying appropriate actions to improve compliance and cooperation with ICCAT measures pursuant to the requirements of Recommendation 06-13 and other relevant ICCAT instruments; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS RESOLVES THAT: When determining non -compliance and appropriate actions to address non -compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures, the following guidelines for an ICCAT schedule of actions will be applied: Step 1: Determination of category of non-compliance(s) Primary areas of focus should include: Category A: Conservation and/or Management, including: - Failure to limit catches/landings to agreed limits - Failure to restrict fleet size or other capacity measures to agreed limits - Failure to implement time/area closures - Failure to implement minimum size restrictions - Failure to implement gear restrictions/limitations Category B: Reporting requirements, including: - Failure to report or delay in reporting statistical and other required data - Failure to submit or delay in submitting reports Category C: Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (MCS) measures, including: - Failure to implement MCS measures, including, inter alia, catch documentation schemes/statistical document programs, observer programs, transhipment controls, and VMS requirements - Failure to exercise port CPC controls, including port inspection requirements - Failure to exercise flag CPC controls 377 Step 2: Determination of the severity of non-compliance(s) Non-compliance can range from minor to significant. Highest priority should be given to determining and addressing significant non-compliance, although responsive action may also be warranted in other cases. Minor non-compliance: These failures are first time or infrequent and do not significantly impact the work of the Commission or SCRS or diminish effectiveness of ICCAT’s conservation and management measures. In most of these cases, the only necessary action would be to request the relevant CPC to rectify the situation and report back to the Compliance Committee on actions taken in this regard at the subsequent annual meeting of the Commission. In general, the preferred method for making such requests and t racking the issue would be through the COC meeting report, though the COC may, depending on the circumstances, recommend sending a Letter of Concern regarding their non-compliance to the CPC(s) in question. Significant non-compliance: These non-compliance issues reflect a CPC’s systematic disregard of ICCAT regulations or infrequent (and even first time) violations that individually or collectively significantly impact the objectives of the Commission or SCRS or diminish the effectiveness of ICCAT's conservation and management measures. These non-compliance issues could include frequent non-reporting or insufficient reporting that impacts the COC’s ability to evaluate the compliance of a CPC effectively. Failures of this nature meet t he threshold for identification under the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning Trade Measures [Rec. 06-13]. To facilitate CPCs’ comprehensive understanding of what constitutes minor or significant non -compliance in the context of existing Recommendations, the COC will develop a reference document, including a simple summary or table that lists the level of severity of types of non-compliance with specific ICCAT provisions, understanding that mitigating and aggravating considerations will also be taken into account as specified above. Mitigating and aggravating considerations: Both mitigating and aggravating considerations, as indicated below, should be taken into account when determining the significance of non-compliance: - Mitigating considerations include, inter alia: (1) the extent to which available capacity building and assistance programs have been used by a CPC to improve its ability to meet its ICCAT obligations and (2) any actions taken by the CPC to address its non -compliance or by a third party CPC in response to the non-compliance of another CPC’s vessel. - Aggravating considerations include, inter alia: (1) non-compliance that is repeated, frequent, numerous, and/or severe in degree, scope, and/or effect, individually or cumulatively; and (2) lack of effective corrective action by the flag CPC or third party CPC (if appropriate). Step 3: Application of actions to address compliance failures, where warranted Upon a determination that non -compliance has occurred pursuant to Step 1 and that further action by ICCAT, potentially including identification under Rec. 06-13, is warranted pursuant to Step 2, actions should be taken or required in one or more of the fol lowing categories: enhanced reporting requirements, restrictions on fishing activities, additional MCS requirements, and/or, as a last resort, trade restrictive measures. In that regard, a non-exhaustive, non-prioritized list of actions that could be taken or required by type of non-compliance as follows: Category A: Non-compliance involving conservation and/or management: Required/Automatic Actions Pursuant to Binding ICCAT Recommendations: - In the case of binding quota/catch limit overharvest, 100% payback as specified in Rec. 00- 14 and other relevant ICCAT recommendations. 378 Potential Actions: - Additional reporting requirements, possibly including: - More frequent catch reporting - Fishery restrictions, possibly including: - Reduction in quota allocation(s) - Additional quota/catch limit reductions - Enhanced MCS requirements, possibly including: - Enhanced reporting requirements - Limitations on at sea transshipment - Increased port sampling and/or inspection - Increased observer requirements - Enhanced VMS requirements (fleets covered or polling rate used) - Fishery restrictions, possibly including: - Individual vessel quota requirements - Bycatch retention limit requirements - Size class limitations - Fleet capacity limits or reductions - Time and/or area restrictions - Gear restrictions or requirements - Trade restrictive measures Category B: Non-compliance involving reporting requirements: Required/Automatic Actions Pursuant to Binding ICCAT Recommendations: In the case of Task 1 data, application of the Recommendation by ICCAT on Penalties Applicable in Case of Non Fulfilment of Reporting Obligations [Rec. 11-15] Potential Actions: - Additional reporting requirements, possibly including: - More frequent reporting - Submission of a data improvement and/or reporting plan with required reporting on implementation - Enhanced MCS requirements, possibly including: - Increased observer coverage requirements for data collection - Increased port sampling requirements - Enhanced VMS requirements (fleets covered or polling rate used) - Fishery restrictions, possibly including - Allocation or quota/catch limit reductions - Limitations/reductions in fleet capacity levels - Increased port inspection - Limitations on or Loss of right to implement certain ICCAT recommendations, such as to charter or conduct at sea transshipment - Trade restrictive measures Category C: Non-compliance involving MCS measures, including: Potential Actions: - Additional reporting requirements, possibly including: - More frequent reporting - Submission of a performance improvement plan with required reporting - Enhanced MCS requirements, possibly including: - Increased observer coverage requirements, possibly including use of ICCAT observers, - Increased port controls, such as more frequent port calls, expanded inspection requirements, and/or designation of authorized ports 379 - Limitations on or prohibition of at sea transshipment - Enhanced VMS requirements (fleets covered or polling rate used) - Fishery restrictions, possibly including: - Allocation or quota/catch limit reductions - Limitations/reductions in fleet capacity levels - Restrictions on posting vessels to the authorized vessel list - Placement of vessels on the IUU vessel list - Requirement to specify individual vessel quotas - Trade restrictive measures 380 18-07 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO AMEND ICCAT REPORTING DEADLINES IN ORDER TO FACILITATE AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT COMPLIANCE PROCESS (Entry into force 21 June 2019) RECOGNIZING the substantial amount of information that must be reviewed and analyzed to prepare for meetings of the Compliance Committee (COC); NOTING that in 2016, ICCAT adopted Resolution by ICCAT to Facilitate an Effective and Efficient Compliance Process (Res. 16-22), which mandates the COC Chair and Secretariat staff to review reports, prepare compliance summary tables, and aim to circulate the tables to the Commission three weeks prior to the Commission meeting; CONCERNED that the October 1 deadline to submit complete Annual Reports established in Recommendation 16 -16 does not allow sufficient time to the Secretariat to process the reports, seek corrections from CPCs, compile the reports, and for the COC Chair and Secretariat to then sufficiently review all Annual Reports and other relevant documents and develop and circulate the first draft of the Compliance Summary tables by the deadline set forth in Resolution 16-22; FURTHER NOTING that the separate deadlines for Part I and Part II of the reports results in administrative delays for the Secretariat, which in turn delays the review of those reports under Resolution 16-22; CONSIDERING that an earlier and single submission date for the entire Annual Report (both Parts I and II) and other reports that contain information relevant to assessing CPC compliance will afford a more timely review of this information and in turn provide CPCs with more time to develop responses to issues raised regarding their compliance with ICCAT requirements; FURTHER NOTING that a change in the Annual Report deadline necessitates changes to deadlines of certain other reports, as the Annual Report requires CPCs to report on their submission of these other reports; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. The first paragraph of Paragraph 2 of the Revised Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual Reports (Ref. 12-13), shall be replaced with the following text: “Complete Annual Reports, comprising Part I and Part II, should be submitted by September 15 of each year, unless the SCRS meeting takes place prior to September 22, in which case Part I should be submitted to the SCRS one week before the start of the SCRS Plenary Session (i.e., by 9:00 am on the first day of the Species Groups meetings), as notified to the Commission by the Secretariat.” 2. Deadlines in the following ICCAT instruments shall be amended to September 15, as follows: a) Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the ICCAT Bigeye Tuna Statistical Document Program (Rec. 01-21), paragraph 5, (data from the Bigeye Tuna Statistical Document, first semester currently due 1 October). b) Recommendation by ICCAT Establishing a Swordfish Statistical Document Program (Rec. 01 -22), paragraph 5, (data from the Swordfish Statistical Document, first semester currently due 1 October). 3. The Secretariat shall make these modifications in the published versions of the instruments amended by paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Recommendation. 4. In accordance with Recommendation 16 -16, the Secretariat shall modify paragraph 1 of Recommendation 11-11 to reflect the August 15 deadline for compliance reporting tables established in Rec. 16-13 and remove Recommendation 16-16 from the Compendium. 381 18-10 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT CONCERNING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEMS IN THE ICCAT CONVENTION AREA (Entry into force: 21 June 2019) RECALLING previous recommendations by ICCAT establishing minimum standards for satellite - based vessel monitoring systems (VMS), in particular Recommendation 03-14; RECOGNIZING the developments in satellite-based VMS, and their utility within ICCAT; RECOGNIZING the legitimate right of coastal States to monitor the vessels fishing in waters under their jurisdiction; CONSIDERING that real-time transmission to the Fishing Monitoring Center (FMC) of the coastal State of VMS data of all the vessels (including catching, carrier and support vessels) flying the flag of a CPC authorised to fish ICCAT species facilitates monitoring, contr ol and surveillance by the coastal State to ensure the effective implementation of ICCAT conservation and monitoring measures; MINDFUL that the SCRS acknowledged in its 2017 report that the higher the frequency of reporting the more useful VMS data are and that a 4 -hour frequency of transmission is insufficient to detect fishing activity for many gear types; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Notwithstanding stricter requirements that may apply in specific ICCAT fisheries, each flag Contracting Party, Cooperating non-Contracting Party, Entity or Fishing Entity (hereinafter referred to as CPC) shall implement a Vessel Monitoring System (hereinaf ter referred to as VMS) for its commercial fishing vessels exceeding 20 meters between perpendiculars or 24 meters length overall (LOA) as well as, begin ning no later than 1 January 2020, those above 15 meters LOA authorized to fish in waters beyond jurisdiction of the flag CPC and: a) Require its fishing vessels to be equipped with an autonomous, tamper -evident system that continuously, automatically, and independent of any intervention by the vessel, transmits messages to the FMC of the flag CPC to track the position, course, and speed of a fishing vessel by the flag CPC of that vessel. b) Ensure that the satellite tracking device fitted on board the fishing vessel collects and transmits continuously to the FMC of the flag CPC the following data: i) the vessel’s identification; ii) the geographical position of the vessel (longitude, latitude) with a margin of error lower than 500 meters, with a confidence interval of 99%; and iii) the date and time. c) Ensure that the FMC of the flag CPC receives an automatic notification if communication between the FMC and the satellite tracking device is interrupted. d) Ensure, in cooperation with the coastal State, that the position messages transmitted by its vessels while operating in waters under the jurisdiction of that coastal State are also transmitted automatically and in real time to the FMC of the coastal State that has authorized the activity. In implementing this provision, due consideration should be been given to minimizing the operational costs, technical difficulties, and administrative burden associated with transmission of these messages. 382 e) In order to facilitate the transmission and receipt of position messages, as described in subparagraph 1(d), the FMC of the flag CPC and the FMC of the coastal State shall exchange their contact information and notify each other without delay of any changes to this information. The FMC of the coastal State shall notify the flag CPC FMC of any interruption in the reception of consecutive position messages. The transmission of position messages between the FMC of the flag CPC and that of the coastal State sha ll be carried out electronically using a secure communication system. 2. Each CPC shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the VMS messages are transmitted and received, as specified in paragraph 1, and use this information to continuously track the position of its vessels. 3. Each CPC shall ensure that the masters of fishing vessels flying its flag ensure that the satellite tracking devices are permanently and continuously operational and that the information identified in paragraph 1b) is collected and transmitted 63F 1 at least once every hour for purse seine vessels and at least once every two hours for all other vessels 64F 2. In addition, CPCs shall require that their vessel operators ensure that: a) the satellite tracking device is not tampered with in any way; b) VMS data are not altered in any way; c) the antennae connected to the satellite tracking device is not obstructed in any way; d) the satellite tracking device is hardwired into the fishing vessel and the power supply is not intentionally interrupted in any way; and e) the satellite tracking device is not removed from the vessel except for the purposes of repair or replacement. 4. In the event of a technical failure or non -operation of the satellite tracking device fitted on board a fishing vessel, the device shall be repaired or replaced within one month from the time of the event, unless the vessel has been removed from the list of authorized LSFVs, where applicable, or for vessels not required to be included on ICCAT’s authorized vessel list, the authorization to fish in areas beyond the jurisdiction of the flag CPC no longer applies. The vessel shall not be authorized to commence a fishing trip with a defective satellite tracking device. Furthermore, when a device stops functioning or has a technical failure during a fishing trip, the repair or the replacement shall take place as soon as the vessel enters a port; the fishing vesse l shall not be authorized to commence a fishing trip without the satellite tracking device having been repaired or replaced. 5. Each CPC shall ensure that a fishing vessel with a defective satellite tracking device shall communicate to the FMC, at least daily, reports containing the information in paragraph 1b) by other means of communication (radio, web-based reporting, electronic mail, telefax or telex). 6. A CPC may allow a vessel to power down its satellite tracking device only if the vessel will not be fishing for an extended period of time (e.g., in dry dock for repairs), and it notifies the competent authorities of its flag CPC in advance. The satellite tracking device must be re-activated, and collect and transmit at least one report, prior to the vessel leaving port. 7. CPCs are encouraged to extend the application of this Recommendation to their fishing vessels not already covered pursuant to paragraph 1, as appropriate, to ensure the effective monitoring of compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures. 8. CPCs are encouraged to cooperate, as appropriate and in accordance with their domestic laws, by sharing data reported under paragraph 1b to support Monitoring Control and Surveillance (MCS) activities. 1 In the event that the connection between the satellite tracking device and the satellite is unavailable, the information iden tified in paragraph 1b) shall still be collected in accordance with paragraph 3 but may instead be transmitted as soon as the satellite connection becomes available. 2 Developing CPCs may choose to apply this polling and transmission requirement (two hours) to their purse seiners targeting sm all tuna species in the Mediterranean. 383 9. The Commission shall review this Recommendation no later than 20 20 and consider the need for revisions to improve its effectiveness. 10. To inform this review, the SCRS is requested to provide advice on the VMS data that would most assist the SCRS in carrying out is work, including frequency of transmission for the different ICCAT fisheries. 11. This measure repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT Amending Recommendation 03-14 by ICCAT Concerning Minimum Standards for the Establishment of a Vessel Monitoring System in the ICCAT Convention Area (Rec. 14-09). 384 19-09 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON VESSEL SIGHTINGS (Entry into force 20 June 2020) RECOGNIZING the o ngoing efforts by ICCAT and its CP Cs to combat Illegal, Un reported, and Unregulated fishing for ICCAT species; AWARE that those efforts will be inf ormed and supported by an effective mechanism for CPCs and their flagged vessels to gather and report information on sightings of foreign-flagged vessels or vessels without na tionality that may be op erating in the Convention Area in a manner contrary to ICCAT conservation and management measures; NOTING, therefore, the utility of combining and updating the Resolution by ICCAT on Compliance with the ICCAT Conservation and Management Measures (Res. 94-09) and the Recommendation by ICCAT on Transshipments and Vessel Sightings (Rec. 97-11); THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) shall c ollect, th rough enforcement and surv eillance oper ations conducted by their competent authorities in the Convention area, as much information as feasible when a foreign-flagged vessel or vessel without nationality is sighted as engaged in fishing or fishing related act ivities (e.g., transshipment) that are presumed to be illegal, unreported, and unregulated, as defined under paragraph 1 of Recommendation 18 -081. An indicative list of information to be collected is included in the sighting information sheet (Annex), which should be used for transmitting information on vessel sightings to the Executive Secretary as specified below. 2. When a vessel is sighted pursuant to paragraph 1 the sighting CPC shall without undue delay notify and provide any recorded images of the vessel to the appropriate authorities of the flag CPC or flag non-CPC of the sighted vessel, and: a) If the sighted vessel is flagged to a CPC, the flag CPC shall, without undue delay, take appropriate action with respect to the vessel in question. Both the sighting CPC and the flag CPC of the sighted vessel shall provide, as appr opriate, i nformation on the sig hting to the Exe cutive Secr etary, including details of any follow-up actions taken. b) If the sighted vessel is flagged to a non-CPC, is of indeterminate flag, or is without nationality, the sighting CPC shall, without undue delay, provide to the Executive Secretary all appropriate information related to the sighting. 3. When a vessel is sighted pursuant to paragraph 1 and there are reasonable grounds to suspect the vessel is without nationality, a Contracting Party is encouraged to board the vessel to confirm its nationality. If the vessel is confirmed to be without natio nality, a competent authority of the Contracting Party is encouraged to inspect the vessel, consistent with international law and, if evidence so warrants, the Contracting Party is encouraged to take such action as may be appropriate, in accordance with in ternational law. Any Contracting Party that conducts a boarding of a vessel operating without nationality shall notify the Executive Secretary without undue delay. 1 This measure was replaced by Recommendations 21-13 and 23-16. 385 4. CPCs are encouraged, upon the consent of the flag State, to board and inspect vessels of non -CPCs conducting fishing or fishing related activities for tuna and tuna-like species and other species caught in association with these speci es, in waters of the Convention Area b eyond n ational jurisdiction. Appropriate information collected from such boardings shall be reported to the Executive Secretary. If a CPC concludes, following boarding and inspection under this paragraph, that the non -CPC vessel was not, in fact, undermining ICCAT conservation measures, the vessel shall not be subject to the presumption under paragraph 1 of Rec. 98-11. 5. CPCs should encourage their fishing and support vessels that operate in the Convention Area to collect and report relevant information to their appropriate domestic authorities to support the vessel sighting process set forth in this Recommendation. 6. The Executive Secretary shall promptly forward any information received pursuant to this Recommendation to all CPCs and report it to the Commission for consideration at the next ICCAT annual meeting. 7. CPCs are encouraged to notify the Executive Secretary of their points of contact to facilitate cooperation and other appropriate actions under this recommendation. The Executive Secretary shall publish this information on the ICCAT website. 8. This recommendation replaces and repeals Resolution by ICCAT on Compliance with the ICCAT Conservation and Manag ement Measures (Res. 94-09) and the Recommendation by ICCAT on Transshipments and Vessel Sightings (Rec. 97-11). 386 SIGHTING INFORMATION SHEET 1.

THE ABOVE INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED BY: NAME: TITLE: MEANS OF SIGHTING (including vessel/aircraft name, where appropriate): DATE: (Month) (Day) (Year) SIGNATURE: Annex 387 19-10 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OBSERVERS IN ICCAT’S REGIONAL OBSERVER PROGRAMS (Entry into force 20 June 2020) UNDERSCORING that safety of life at sea is a longstanding objective of international maritime governance, that observers collect data that are essential to the functions of the Commission, and that the health, safety, and welfare of observers is critical to their ability to perform their duties; RECALLING the regional observer programs (ROPs) established in the Recommendation by ICCAT on a Program for Transshipment (Rec. 16-151) and the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 18-02 establishing a multi -annual management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 19-042); CONCERNED that ICCAT recommendations establishing these ROPs do not include requirements that adequately protect the health, safety, and welfare of observers; ACKNOWLEDGING the need for comprehensive and consistent requirements in ICCAT to protect the health, safety, and welfare of observers, in particular to supply necessary safety equipment and to provide or ensure proper training and to establish emergency procedures with respect to ICCAT ROPs; RECALLING that the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watch keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (STCW-F), adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1995, sets forth safety training standards for personnel serving onboard seagoing fishing vessels; NOTING the commitments in international law, including the provisions of the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, with regard to the development of an international maritime search and rescue plan for the rescue of persons in distress at sea; NOTING existing contracts between the ICCAT Secretariat and ICCAT ROP observer providers that include observer health and safety requirements as well as associated materials establishing procedures for the implementation of such requirements; ALSO RECALLING the Resolution by ICCAT on harmonisation and improved observer safety (Res. 19-16); THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: The following shall apply to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of observers deployed pursuant to ICCAT ROPs established in the Recommendation by ICCAT on a Program for Transshipment (Rec. 16-15*) and the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 18 -02 establishing a multi -annual management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 19-04): 1. The observer provider shall provide or ensure observers have received safety training before they are deployed on a vessel for the first time and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Such training program must, at a minimum, meet the International Maritime Organization (IMO) safety training standards. 2. Before deploying an observer on a vessel for a trip, the observer provider shall ensure the observer is issued the following safety equipment: a) an independent two-way satellite communication device suitable for use at sea and a waterproof personal life-saving beacon, which may consist of a single device such as a Satellite Emergency Notification Device, or a combination of an independent two -way satellite-based device, (e.g. an inReach messaging device) and a personal locator beacon (e.g., a ResQ Link device); and 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 21-15 and 24-15. 2 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 21-08, 22-08 and 24-05. 388 b) other safety equipment, such as personal flotation devices (PFDs) and immersion suits, appropriate to the specific fishing operations and activities, including ocean area and distance from shore. 3. The observer provider shall have a designated contact point for deployed observers to use in cases of emergency. 4. The observer provider must have an established procedure for contacting and being contacted by the observer and the vessel, and, if necessary, for contacting the competent authority of the flag CPC or non-CPC. This procedure must provide for regularly scheduled contact with observers to confirm their health, safety, and welfare status and clearly describe the steps that must be taken in the event of various emergencies, including situations where an observer dies, is missing or presumed fallen overboard, suffers from a serious illness or injury that puts his or her health or safety at risk, has been assaulted, intimidated, threatened or harassed while on board a vessel, or if the observer requests to be removed from the vessel prior to the conclusion of the trip. 5. Flag CPCs or non-CPCs shall ensure their vessels that carry observers under an ICCAT ROP are outfitted with appropriate safety equipment for the entirety of each voyage, including the following: a) A life raft of sufficient capacity for all persons onboard and with a certificate of inspection that is valid throughout the observer’s deployment; b) Life jackets or survival suits of sufficient number for all persons onboard, and compliant with relevant international standards, such as, where applicable, the Cape Town Agreement; and c) A properly registered Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) and a Search and Rescue Transponder (SART) that will not expire until after the observer deployment ends. CPCs may choose to exempt their vessels less than 12m in length overall (LOA) and operating within 5 nm of the baseline from the requirement to have an EPIRB. 6. The observer provider shall not deploy an observer on a vessel unless and until the observer is allowed to inspect all vessel safety equipment and document and report its status to the observer provider; observers shall not be deployed on vessels with outs tanding safety discrepancies, in particular if the vessel does not meet the requirements of paragraph 5. If, during deployment, the observer provider or flag CPC or non -CPC determines that a serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the observer exists, the observer shall be removed from the vessel unless and until the risk is addressed. 7. Flag CPCs and non-CPCs with vessels carrying observers deployed under an ICCAT ROP shall develop and implement an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to be followed in the event an observer dies, is missing or presumed fallen overboard, suffers from a serious illness or injury that threatens his or her health, safety, or welfare, or has been assaulted, intimidated, threatened or harassed. Such EAPs must include, inter alia, the elements in Annex 1 of this Recommendation. These EAPs shall be submitted to the Executive Secretary for posting on the ICCAT web site as soon as possible after the entry into force of this recommendation. New or amended EAPs shall be provided to the Executive Secretary for posting when they become available. 8. Beginning on 1 January 2021, vessels flagged to CPCs or non-CPCs that have not submitted EAPs shall not be eligible to carry an observer from an ICCAT ROP. Further, should available information indicate that an EAP is not consistent with the standards set out in Annex 1, the Commission may decide that the deployment of an observer on a vessel of the concerned flag CPC or non-CPC shall be delayed until the inconsistency has been sufficiently addressed. 9. The Commission may also decide that a vessel is ineligible to carry an ICCAT regional observer where the flag CPC or non -CPC has previously failed to investigate any reported instances of observer interference, harassment, intimidation, assault, or unsafe working conditions or, where warranted, to take appropriate corrective action, consistent with their domestic law. 389 10. The observer provider and flag CPCs and non-CPCs with vessels carrying observers deployed under an ICCAT ROP shall submit to the Executive Secretary reports on observer incidents triggering provisions of the EAP, including any corrective action taken by the flag CPC or non -CPC. The Executive Secretary shall transmit such reports to the Commission, consistent with applicable confidentiality rules, for its review at each annual meeting or, where warranted, more frequently. 11. Flag CPCs and non -CPCs shall cooperate to the maximum extent possible with and provide for the participation of, as appropriate and consistent with domestic law, the CPC or non-CPC of the observer in search and rescue operations and investigations of cases where the observer dies, is missing or presumed fallen overboard, suffers from a serious illness or injury that threatens his or her health or safety, or has been assaulted, intimidated, threatened or harassed while on board a vessel. 12. The Executive Secretary shall notify concerned flag CPCs and non-CPCs that a condition of participating in any ICCAT ROP is the development, implementation, and submission of an EAP as described in paragraphs 7 and 8 above. 13. Nothing in this recommendation shall prejudice the exercise of discretion by the observer provider not to deploy an observer on a vessel because of concerns about risk to the observer’s health, safety, or welfare. 14. Nothing in this measure shall prejudice the rights of relevant CPCs and non-CPCs to enforce their laws with respect to the safety of observers consistent with international law. 15. This recommendation shall be reviewed three years after its adoption, taking into account any guidance from FAO on standards related to fisheries observer safety as requested by the Joint FAO/IMO/ILO Ad Hoc Working Group on Illegal, Unreported and Unregul ated Fishing and Related Matters. 390 Annex 1 Elements of ROP Emergency Action Plan (EAP) 1. In the event that an ROP observer dies, is missing or presumed fallen overboard, the CPC or non-CPC to which the fishing vessel is flagged shall take necessary measures to require that the fishing vessel: a) immediately ceases all fishing operations; b) immediately notifies the appropriate Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC), flag CPC or non-CPC, and the observer provider; c) immediately commences search and rescue if the observer is missing or presumed fallen overboard, and searches for at least 72 hours, unless the observer is found sooner, or unless instructed by the flag CPC or non-CPC to continue searching3 6; d) immediately alerts other vessels in the vicinity by using all available means of communication; e) cooperates fully in any search and rescue operation; f) whether or not the search is successful, promptly returns to the nearest port for further investigation, as agreed by the flag CPC or non-CPC and the observer provider; g) promptly provides a report on the incident to the observer provider and appropriate flag State authorities; and h) cooperates fully in all official investigations, and preserves any potential evidence and the personal effects and quarters of the deceased or missing observer. 2. In addition, in the event that an ROP observer dies while deployed, the flag CPC or non -CPC shall require that the fishing vessel ensure that the body is well-preserved for the purposes of an autopsy and investigation. 3. In the event that an ROP observer suffers from a serious illness or injury that threatens his or her health or safety, the CPC or non -CPC to which the fishing vessel is flagged shall take necessary measures to require that the fishing vessel: a) immediately ceases fishing operations; b) immediately notifies the flag CPC or non -CPC, observer provider, and relevant MRCC to advise if a medical evacuation is warranted; c) takes all reasonable actions to care for the observer and provide any medical treatment available and possible on board the vessel; d) where necessary and appropriate, including as directed by the observer provider, if not already directed by the flag CPC or non-CPC, facilitates the disembarkation and transport of the observer to a medical facility equipped to provide the required care, as soon as practicable; and e) cooperates fully in any and all official investigations into the cause of the illness or injury. 4. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 through 3, the flag CPC or non-CPC shall ensure that the appropriate MRCC, observer provider, and the Secretariat are immediately notified of the incident, actions taken or underway to address the situation, and any assistance that may be required. 5. In the event that there are reasonable grounds to believe an ROP observer has been assaulted, intimidated, threatened, or harassed such that their health or safety is endangered and the observer or the observer provider indicates to the CPC or non -CPC to which the fishing vessel is flagged that they wish for the observer to be removed from the fishing vessel, the CPC or non -CPC to which the fishing vessel is flagged shall take necessary measures to require that the fishing vessel: a) immediately takes action to preserve the safety of the observer and mitigate and resolve the situation on board; b) notifies the flag CPC or non -CPC and the observer provider of the situation, including the status and location of the observer, as soon as possible; c) facilitates the safe disembarkation of the observer in a manner and place, as agreed by the flag CPC or non -CPC and the observer provider, that facilitates access to any needed medical treatment; and d) cooperates fully in any and all official investigations into the incident. 3 In the event of force majeure, CPCs and non-CPCs may allow their vessels to cease search and rescue operations before 72 hours have elapsed. 391 6. In the event that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an ROP observer has been assaulted, intimidated, threatened, or harassed but neither the observer nor the observer provider wishes that the observer be removed from the fishing vessel, the CPC or non-CPC to which the fishing vessel is flagged shall take necessary measures to require that the fishing vessel: a) takes action to preserve the safety of the observer and mitigate and resolve the situation on board as soon as possible; b) notifies the flag CPC or non -CPC and the observer provider of the situation as soon as possible; and c) cooperates fully in all official investigations into the incident. 7. If any of the events in paragraphs 1 through 5 occur, port CPCs or non -CPCs shall facilitate entry of the fishing vessel to allow disembarkation of the ROP observer and, to the extent possible, assist in any investigations if so requested by the flag CPC or non-CPC. 8. In the event that, after disembarkation from a fishing vessel of an ROP observer, an observer provider identifies, such as during the course of debriefing the observer, a possible situation involving assault or harassment of the observer while on board the fishing vessel, the observer provider shall notify, in writing, the flag CPC or non-CPC and the Secretariat. 9. If notified, under paragraph 5b, 6b, or 8, that an observer has been assaulted or harassed, the flag CPC or non-CPC shall a) investigate the event based on the information provided by the observer provider and take any appropriate action in response to the results of the investigation; b) cooperate fully in any investigation conducted by the observer provider, including providing the report to the observer provider and appropriate authorities of the incident; and c) promptly notify the observer provider and the Secretariat of the results of its investigation and any actions taken. 10. CPCs shall also encourage vessels flying their flag to participate, to the greatest extent possible, in any search and rescue operations involving an ROP observer. 11. Where requested, relevant observer providers and CPCs or non-CPCs shall cooperate in each other’s investigations, including providing their incident reports for any incidents indicated in paragraphs 1 through 6 to facilitate any investigations as appropriate. 392 (Entry into force 20 June 2020) RECALLING that the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 target 1 calls for States to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) constitute a significant part of marine pollution; RECOGNIZING that ghost fishing conducted by ALDFG constitutes an unmanaged and unsustainable exploitation of marine resources that leads to undesirable mortality of marine life; AWARE that retrieving ALDFG will contribute to reducing marine pollution; CONVINCED that the fishing industry can contribute significantly to reducing the amount of ALDFG; NOTING ICCAT Recommendation 03-12 which requires CPCs to mark their fishing gears; FURTHER NOTING that the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations' Committee on Fisheries endorsed Voluntary Guidelines on the Marking of Fishing Gear at its thirty -third session and further work to address ALDFG including the development of a comprehensiv e global strategy to tackle issues relating to ALDFG; ALSO AWARE of the need for an obligation for fishermen not only to mark the fishing gear, but also to report it when abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded, as well as to try to retrieve the gear where possible; ACKNOWLEDGING that retrieving ALDFG without knowing the position of the gear will be challenging; ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING that to prevent ghost fishing, efforts should be undertaken to retrieve ALDFG; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Each CPC shall ensure that its fishing vessels authorized to fish species managed by ICCAT in the Convention area are prohibited from abandoning and discarding fishing gear except for safety reasons, and taking into account the special requirements of developing CPCs in relation to conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and development of fisheries for such stocks, and, in particular, with respect to artisanal and small -scale fisheries. 2. For the purpose of this Recommendation, fishing gear is understood to mean fishing gear that poses a significant risk of ghost fishing when abandoned, lost or discarded in the ICCAT Convention area1. 3. Each CPC shall ensure that: a) vessels 12 metres and above fishing for ICCAT species in the ICCAT Convention area, entitled to fly its flag, have equipment2 on board to retrieve lost fishing gear; and b) the master of a vessel that has lost fishing gear or part of it shall, to the extent possible, make every reasonable attempt to retrieve it as soon as possible. 1 The provisions in this Recommendation do not apply to longline gear. 2 Equipment used to retrieve ALDFG could be a simple anchor attached to a strong rope or wire, or otherwise as defined in the C PCs’ domestic law. RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON ABANDONED, LOST OR OTHERWISE DISCARDED FISHING GEAR GEN 19-11 393 4. If the lost fishing gear cannot be retrieved, the master of the vessel shall notify the flag CPC within 24 hours, or within 24 hours of returning to port when at-sea reporting is not possible, of the following: a) the name and call sign of the vessel; b) the type of lost fishing gear; c) the quantity of fishing gear lost; d) the date and time when the fishing gear was lost; e) the position where the fishing gear was lost; and f) the measures taken by the vessel to retrieve the lost fishing gear. 5.

RECOGNISING that challenges relating to health and safety for observers are global and solutions should be harmonised to the extent possible in order to ensure a level playing field and facilitate implementation at a national level; EMPHASISING that improved dialogue at the national level between the competent authorities and their fishing vessel operators is warranted; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. The Commission will evaluate the outcomes of the fourth meeting of the Joint FAO/IMO/ILO Ad Hoc Working Group on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and Related Matters held in Torremolinos, Spain, 23-25 October 2019, and consider appropriate follow-up actions. 2. CPCs will commit themselves to strengthening the dialogue with their fishing vessel owners, crew and operators with a view of raising awareness of the health and security challenges confronting observers, thus enhancing cooperation between crew members and observers. 395 19-17 GEN RESOLUTION BY ICCAT AMENDING THE RESOLUTION 18-11 BY ICCAT ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROGRAM FOR THE VOLUNTARY EXCHANGE OF INSPECTION PERSONNEL IN FISHERIES MANAGED BY ICCAT (Transmitted to Contracting Parties 20 December 2019) RECALLING Ref. 75-02 for a Scheme of Joint International Inspection and Annex 7 of Recommendation 19-04 establishing a joint international inspection scheme for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery, both relating to areas beyond national jurisdiction; FURTHER RECALLING paragraph 3 of Article IX of the ICCAT Convention and the General Outline of Integrated Monitoring Measures adopted at the 13th Special Meeting of the Commission (Ref. 02-31); NOTING the important role of the trap and farming related activities in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery, part of these activities taking place within the waters under the jurisdiction of the Contracting Parties concerned; NOTING that joint inspection activities have been carried out by Contracting Parties in the Atlantic and other oceans; FURTHER NOTING that voluntary exchange of fisheries inspectors for bluefin tuna trap and farming related activities would equally benefit from an exchange of best practices and inspection expertise on such activities between Contracting Parties directly involved; NOTING that for bluefin tuna trap and farming activities, the fisheries inspector should only be authorized to observe the related control operations of the hosting Contracting Party and exchange of practices, information and experiences related to bluefin tuna trap and farming activities; RECOGNIZING that exchanges of inspectors and observers through a voluntary pilot program will contribute to the capacity of Contracting Parties, particularly developing Contracting Parties, to conduct at sea inspections in ICCAT fisheries; FURTHER RECOGNIZING that extending the voluntary pilot program to bluefin tuna trap and farming related activities would also contribute to the capacity of the Contracting Parties directly involved in the control of such activities; FURTHER RECOGNISING that the voluntary exchange of inspectors is subject to the domestic legislations of the Contracting Parties in force; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS RESOLVES THAT: Program objectives 1. A pilot program is established for the voluntary exchange of inspection personnel to: a) participate in boarding and inspection activities as inspectors or as observing members of the inspection party (hereinafter referred to as “observers” for purposes of this Resolution) conducted by Contracting Parties in fisheries managed by ICCAT pursuant to their existing authorities; b) allow fisheries inspectors from Contracting Parties directly involved in bluefin tuna trap and farming activities, to observe, on a reciprocal basis, the inspection activities conducted with a previous agreement by the hosting Contracting Party; 396 c) facilitate exchanges that are intended to allow the sharing of information, best practices and expertise needed to strengthen at -sea inspection, traps and farming related control activities, capabilities and capacities, enhance cooperation and collaboration among Contracting Parties on these important areas of fisheries monitoring, control, and surveillance, and inform future discussions on this issue within ICCAT. 2. On the conclusion of a standing or ad hoc bilateral agreement or arrangement referred to in paragraph 10, the pilot program referred to in paragraph 1 applies to vessels in areas beyond national jurisdiction or to bluefin trap and/or farming activities. Participation and points of contact 3. All Contracting Parties are encouraged to participate in the pilot program referred to in paragraph 1 and may join or leave it at any time. 4. Contracting Parties interested in participating in the pilot program should submit to the ICCAT Executive Secretary the following information when applicable: a) National authority responsible for at-sea inspection and other supporting maritime agencies as may be appropriate, b) National authority responsible for the bluefin tuna trap and farming activities, and c) Designated point(s) of contact (POC) within that authority with responsibility for program implementation, including name, telephone, fax numbers, and e-mail address. 5. The ICCAT Executive Secretary will make the information provided under paragraph 4 available on the public portion of the ICCAT website, taking into consideration national personal data protection rules. Pilot program process and procedures 6. Contracting Parties that have elected to participate in the pilot program should communicate with one another to identify opportunities for exchanges of inspectors or observers at sea pursuant to this pilot program. Contracting Parties participating in the pilot program for BFT trap and farming activities, should ensure that the inspectors exchanged under this program are only authorized by the hosting Contracting Party to observe the related control operations. 7. Contracting Parties: a) deploying patrol vessels in fisheries managed by ICCAT should consider their participation in the pilot program in developing patrol plans and strive, where possible, to arrange patrols that can accommodate one or more personnel from other Contracting Parties. b) developing inspection plans on their bluefin tuna trap and farming related activities, should consider inviting other Contracting Parties engaged in such activities to send inspectors to observe control related activities in their trap and farms and, c) will provide relevant information to other participating Contracting Parties, as appropriate, in order to determine their interest in an exchange of inspectors or observers, either on a particular patrol or on a bluefin tuna trap and/or farm, that may be planned in the future. 8. Contracting Parties wishing to place inspectors or observers on another Contracting Party’s inspection vessel, or wishing to observe a bluefin tuna trap and/or farming inspection activity, should contact the POC of the Contracting Party that has provided information under paragraph 7, to indicate its interest. 397 9. When a Contracting Party has provided notice of its interest in an exchange of personnel under paragraph 8, the concerned Contracting Parties should consult to determine whether such an exchange could be accommodated, taking into consideration operational and administrative limitations, as well as training, expertise, operational and information on safe, security, m edical and physical requirements, authorization for the venue of the inspections and inspection capacities. Contracting Parties deploying insp ection vessel(s) should make special efforts to accommodate requests from developing Contracting Parties, in particular. 10. Contracting Parties that have chosen to establish an exchange of personnel under this pilot program should enter into a standing or ad hoc bilateral agreement or arrangement to address relevant details of the deployment, including for the purpose of sea boarding and whether the scope of the agreement should be limited to inspections in areas beyond or within national jurisdiction or include national EEZs, or only the site of the bluefin tuna trap and/or farm. The bilateral agreement or arrangement should also determine the role of personnel deployed under the arrangement or agreement, as well as further provisions for the cooperative deployment of inspectors or observers and the use of vessels, aircraft or other resources for fisheries surveillance and control purposes, and the protection of law enforcement sensitive or otherwise confidential or protected information from inappropriate disclosure. 11. The Contracting Party of the inspection personnel deployed should be responsible for all issues associated to safety, medical and physical requirements during the deployment. Reporting and review 12. Contracting Parties who engage in such exchanges should coordinate reporting to the Commission annually on any activities carried out under the pilot program for consideration by the Permanent Working Group for the Improvement of Statistics and Conservation (PWG). Contracting Parties are also encouraged to provide information related to joint inspection activities at sea undertaken outside the context of this pilot program, as appropriate. 13. This pilot program should be reviewed no more than 3 years after adoption. Repeals 14. This Resolution repeals Resolution by ICCAT establishing a pilot program for the voluntary exchange of inspection personnel in fisheries managed by ICCAT (Res. 18-11). 398 21-12 GEN RECOMMENDATION ON VESSELS WITHOUT NATIONALITY (Entry into force 17 June 2022) RECOGNIZING that, consistent with Article 92 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), any vessel not flying the flag of a CPC or non-CPC, or vessels flying the flag of two or more CPCs or non-CPCs shall be considered a vessel without nationality; FURTHER RECOGNIZING that vessels without nationality operate without governance and oversight, contrary to international law; CONCERNED that vessels without nationality fishing or supporting fishing activities in the ICCAT Convention area undermine the objective of the ICCAT Convention and the conservation and management work of the Commission; RECALLING that the FAO International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) Fishing recommends that CPCs take measures consistent with international law in relation to fishing vessels without nationality involved in IUU fishing; NOTING that paragraph 1 of the Recommendation by ICCAT on establishing a list of vessels presumed to have carried out IUU fishing activities (Rec. 18-081) creates a presumption that vessels without nationality that harvest ICCAT species in the Convention area are engaging in IUU fishing activities; FURTHER NOTING that Recommendation by ICCAT on vessel sightings (Rec. 19 -09) establishes the reporting protocol for the sighting of suspicious vessels and steps that may be taken under international law to confirm a vessel’s flag, if it is suspected to be without nationality; ACKNOWLEDGING the obligations set forth in the Recommendation by ICCAT to promote compliance by nationals of Contracting Parties, Cooperating Non-Contracting Parties, Entities, or Fishing Entities with ICCAT conservation and management measures (Rec. 06-142); DETERMINED to continue to deter all facets of IUU fishing activities in the Convention area; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Vessels without nationality fishing or supporting fishing operations in the ICCAT Convention Area are deemed to be operating in contravention of the ICCAT Convention and undermining ICCAT's conservation and management measures. 2.

The 2020 Panel 2 Intersessional Meeting considered initiating discussions on this issue based on a working paper prepared by the EU; RECALLING that new technologies have advanced greatly over the last few years and these technologies can make monitoring more effective and efficient as well as supporting the collection of data for scientific purposes; and, CONSIDERING the establishment of a Pilot Project for the use of REM, including Closed -Circuit Television (CCTV), would allow testing whether these technologies can be used in the future to improve control and make it more efficient, as well as assisting in the automatic collection of data; NOTING that the conclusions drawn from this Pilot Project are without prejudice to the possibility for the CPCs to continue using traditional means of control, including the use of control or scientific observers. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS RESOLVES THAT: Pilot Project objective 1. A Pilot Project is established to test the use of a Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) system, including Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) on board bluefin tuna processing vessels operating in the bluefin tuna fishery in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. 2. The objective of the project is to test the REM system and to evaluate the added value of this technology in improving the monitoring and control of processing vessels, the cost-efficiency of the system and its capacity to collect comprehensive and accurate data and its subsequent analysis. 3. The duration of the Pilot Project should be one year, with the possibility of extending it for a further year. The project should be implemented on at least 2 of the active processing vessels listed in the Table 1. 4. The pilot project would be considered as a testing phase and the information collected in it may only be used to achieve the objectives of the project, but in no case for control or enforcement purposes. Participation and points of contact 5. Contracting Parties with processing vessels operating under their flag are encouraged to participate in the Pilot Project and facilitate the implementation on selected vessels under their flag . All other Contracting Parties involved in the control of processing vessels are also encouraged to participate in the Pilot Project. 6. Contracting Parties participating in the Pilot Project should submit to the Executive Secretary the following information: a) National authority responsible for the processing vessel and its monitoring and control, and b) Designated point(s) of contact within that authority with control responsibilities for liaison on the project, including name, telephone, fax numbers, and e-mail address. 407 7. A Technical Steering Group should be set up to oversee the implementation of the Pilot Project. The Technical Steering Group should be composed at least, by representative(s) of the ICCAT Secretariat, the flag Contracting Parties of the processing vessels included in the Pilot Project and, on a voluntary basis, the coastal Contracting Parties where these vessels operate. The Steering Group should be coordinated by Chair of the former Working Group on Bluefin Tuna Control and Traceability measures, set up by ICCAT Resolution 19-15. 8. The Technical Steering Group should monitor the project’s progress, the fulfilment of its objectives and put forward recommendations for improved implementation of the project. They should be available for regular consultation and regular online meetings. The Steering Group should regulate its own procedures. Implementation of the Pilot Project 9. The ICCAT Secretariat, with the assistance of the Technical Steering Group, should identify a company (contractor) entrusted for the installation and maintenance of the REM system and a company or independent body in charge of auditing the REM data (analys t). The minimum technical standards in Annex 1 should be included in the tender specifications when selecting the contractor and analyst. 10. In the performance of its tasks, the contractor implementing the pilot project and the analyst auditing the REM data should follow the minimum technical standards set out in Annex 1. The analyst should handle the REM data in accordance with the relevant data protection laws. 11. The ICCAT Secretariat, with the assistance of the Technical Steering Group, should identify the vessels to include in the project, following consultations with the flag States and the contractor to assure the feasibility of equipping such vessels. 12. The contractor should prepare a REM Vessel Monitoring Plan (VMP) for the vessels included in the pilot project and should submit it to the ICCAT Secretariat for approval. The ICCAT Secretariat, in consultation with the Steering Group, should evaluate the VMP and approve it if considered adequate for the purposes of the Pilot Project and that it follows the minimum technical standards set out in Annex 1. 13. The analyst should prepare a protocol for the analysis of the REM data and send it to the ICCAT Secretariat. The ICCAT Secretariat, in consultation with the Steering Group, should evaluate the REM data analysis protocol and approve it if considered adequat e for the purposes of the Pilot Project and that it follows the minimum technical standards set out in Annex 1. 14. Contracting Parties participating in the pilot program should communicate and collaborate with each other and with the contractor and analyst in order to facilitate the implementation of the Pilot Project. Data transmission 15. Sensor data and video footage should be transmitted by the processing vessels to ICCAT Secretariat, which in turn will be responsible for transmitting it to the company or body in charge of auditing the data (analyst). The data and video footage will be m ade available to the flag CPC and the coastal CPC where the vessel operates upon request. Reporting 16. The contractor should draw up a report on the alerts and issues identify and to recommend any improvement to the set-up of the system. The analyst should produce reports including details on the implementation of the project and on the data analysed, as we ll as conclusions on the functioning of the project and its effectiveness. The detailed content of the reports and the reporting period will be developed by the Technical Steering Group. 17. The ICCAT Secretariat should keep all Contracting Parties updated on the progress of the project and should distribute the progress reports drawn up by the contractor and analyst and the evaluations of the Steering Group. 408 Annex 1 Minimum technical standards for an ICCAT system of Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) 1. Minimum technical standards The Remote Electronic System (REM) software should be developed to handle and control sensors and cameras, store sensor data and video footage on embedded storage, and to display all information on a screen in the wheelhouse, allowing the crew to monitor the functioning of the system. The system must be capable of storing data and video footage for the entire period of operation of the vessel (trip). The REM system should incorporate a self -test function including at least position check, memory status check, camera image check, and sensor operation check. The system should allow the master to test it and ensure it is fully functional at all times and that it meets all the required standards. The system should be able to deliver automatically, to the master and the competent body, health messages and warnings, including warnings for missing data, malfunction or tamper events. The REM system must comply with the following minimum technical standards: a) include a sufficient number of cameras to monitor the fishing activity (considered, for the purpose of this Resolution, the loading of BFT, weighing, processing, storing, transhipment and landing), b) include sensors that monitor parameters to detect when fishing activity occurs or may be occurring, c) be capable of securely storing E -monitoring records and have enough storage and back -up storage, in accordance with the number of cameras and the duration of the trip, d) supports remote access/configuration and have Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and controlled shutdown, e) be of sufficient camera resolution that allows the counting of the number of specimens, f) include a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to monitor vessel position, route and speed as well as provide information on operation times and location, even during periods of poor visibility or at night (i.e. may be supported by IR lighting), g) be capable of issuing real time automated alerts when the system is malfunctioning, h) be tamper evident and prevent any manual data input or external data manipulation, i) be robust and withstand rough conditions at-sea with minimum human intervention. 2. Installation of the REM system A certified REM Vessel Monitoring Plan (VMP) would be necessary in order to stablish the layout of sensors and cameras and other relevant technical specifications to cover all monitoring needs. It should include at least the following elements: - General information of the vessels, including vessel length and contact details of the vessel owner and/or representative; - Vessel plan and pictures; - General description of the settings of sensors and cameras; - System components location and characteristics, including image of its location; - For or each of the cameras: view and objectives, image of location, camera settings and a picture of the camera shot, showing the field of view the camera should cover. 409 2.1 Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) The number and field of view of the cameras should be such as to monitor all areas where BFT can be loaded, processed or weighed and to ensure in particular that all areas where tuna can be transferred on board are covered. As a general setup, the position of the camera should cover both sides of the vessel and allow the number of specimens transferred on board to be counted and to identify, if possible, vessels that will be attached to the processing vessel. Since all receiv ing and processing operations of tuna take place on the main ship's deck, a camera with a general overview of the deck would ensure effective control. An additional camera installed in the deck area where the fish is received and processed would make it possible to ensure a count of the number of individuals in a case where it was not possible to do so when the fish was lifted by the crane. Where possibl e, it should be ensured that this camera is equipped with measuring capability (lens dependable) to allowing for the automatic determination of the sizes of the individuals taken on board and to assist in the collection of fish size data to be used for scientific purposes, supporting at the same time weight control. In parallel or alternatively, an ichthyometer or graduated rule, with an easily visible colour scale, may be placed in this area allowing to monitor a size sampling that may be set for scientific purposes. The cameras and the camera housing need to be constructed of material that can resist the environment on board the vessel, be tamper-proof and that camera closure fittings are robust and durable. Due to the large size of the video footage, the possibility of using on some or all cameras, photographs taken every few seconds instead of continuous video, during periods when the sensors indicate that there is no activity, should also be evaluated during the pilot project, since this alternative would allow to reduce very significantly the size of the files and facilitate its management. The master should endeavour to ensure that the REM system is fully functional and that CCTV systems provide clear, unobstructed footage during operation. The cameras would not need to be recording when the vessel is sailing above a certain speed. Digital signature (date and time stamp, vessel name, vessel registration and GPS coordinates), should be able to associate the video footage with a particular event in time (i.e. to check that the operation was authorized or that it has been correctly recorded). When possible, masking capability, with the possibility to blank out parts of images for personal protection purposes and to select areas of interest, should be included. 2.2 Sensors The sensors should provide information on the possible occurrence of fishing activities. These sensors would be placed on those devices or mechanisms that are active when the vessel is or may be carrying out fishing activities, such as fish loading, proces sing, freezing or landing. This information would be mainly used to select the video footage to be analysed. The sensors should also collect information on weighing operations, which will make it easier to monitor activity and allow automatic data crosschecks. The REM systems should be able to support all types of sensors needed and a data -bus connection should be available for possible future expansions. 410 The following sensors should be included: 1. GPS; 2. opening of hatches or other access to the hold; 3. activation of the cranes; 4. scales used to weigh the BFT with the possibility of registering the weighing operations carried out.72F 1 Other sensors whose usefulness can be assessed are: 5. activity in the freezing tunnels (introduction of fish) or motion sensors; 6. temperature in fish hold; 3. Data storage and transmission All the information should be stored in the control box and the requested data should be secured to prevent possible deletion or tampering. A backup must be made automatically. All data being stored or transmitted could be compressed and securely encrypted. Because in case of use of different systems there could be problems of data compatibility, the format of the data, both from sensors and video footage, should be unique or compatible, so that the different authorities involved in their analysis would have no problem reading and analysing them. All vessels in the pilot project should use the same REM provider (single procurement for one single system), as this will ensure the best possible data exchange and facilitate data analysis. Sensor data and video footage will be stored only for the period necessary for the implementation of this pilot project and in any case for a maximum of 3 years. The storage and management of the video footage should take into account technical options, possible legislation on privacy and data protection and comply with the relevant Personal Data Protection Regulations. The data should be transmitted via mobile data networks, via WiFi (when the ship approaches the coast and enters WiFi or 4G coverage) or via satellite system. In case of technical failures in the transmission system, information should be shared through the exchange of hard disks. DAT ANALYSIS 4. Data analysis REM systems on board the vessels should be able to deliver the sensor data and video footage in a specified common format for exchange (output). The land based analysing software (REM analyser) should allow to associate the data of the sensors with the video footage, facilitating and speeding up the analysis of the video footage. The selection of the video footage to be analysed would be based on: 1. Risk analysis, using at least: - analysis of sensor data (i.e. crane activity or opening of hatches at times when the vessel is not authorized to transfer fish); - the weight or numbers of individuals (number of weighing events) transmitted by the scale sensors do not correspond to the quantities recorded; 1 The use of scales attached to the cranes, method already used by most of these vessels, is considered of great interest becau se it would allow to record and transmit the weight of all the fish taken on board. It should be assessed whether the currently ava ilable scales can be adapted to the REM system. 411 - vessel detention while in navigation (possibility of transhipment at sea); - system alerts for malfunction, missing data or tampering attempts; - VMS information indicating activity by other vessels in the vicinity of the processing vessel or non-receipt of auxiliary vessel positions associated with the farm; - other intelligence information held by the authorities; and, 2. Random examination: Comprising the analysis of sensor data and video footage from some randomly selected full days. Random analysis of some of the operations would allow to verify that the amounts declared by the operators correspond to those shown in the video footage (number of individuals) and in the weighing sensor data for these operations. The analysis of the data based on risk analysis would imply that the control authorities where the processing vessel is operating should make available to the company in charge of auditing the data, certain information such as periods in which authorization has been given to do harvesting or quantities reported by the processing vessel.

This plan stipulates that the identification of the vessels carrying out illegal unregul ated and unreported (IUU) activities should follow agreed procedures and be applied in an equitable, transparent and non-discriminatory way; CONCERNED by the fact that IUU fishing activities in the ICCAT Convention area continue, and these activities diminish the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures; FURTHER CONCERNED that there is evidence of a large number of vessel owners engaged in such fishing activities which have re -flagged their vessels to avoid compliance with ICCAT management and conservation measures, and to evade the ICCAT-adopted non-discriminatory trade measures; DETERMINED to address the challenge of an increase in IUU fishing activities by way of counter - measures to be applied in respect to the vessels, without prejudice to further measures adopted in respect of flag States under the relevant ICCAT instruments; CONSIDERING the results of the ICCAT Ad Hoc Working Group on Measures to Combat IUU Fishing Meeting, which was held in Tokyo, Japan from 27 to 31 May 2002; CONSCIOUS of the urgent need to address the issue of large-scale fishing vessels as well as other vessels conducting IUU fishing and fishing related activities in support of IUU fishing; NOTING that the situation must be addressed in the light of all relevant international fisheries instruments and in accordance with the relevant rights and obligations established in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement; DESIRING to streamline and improve IUU listing procedures and requirements in previous ICCAT Recommendations and Resolutions; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Definition of IUU activities 1. For the purposes of this Recommendation, vessels are presumed to have carried out illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities in the ICCAT Convention area when a Contracting Party or a Cooperating non -Contracting Party, Entity or Fishing E ntity (hereinafter referred to as CPC), presents evidence that such vessels: a) Harvest tuna and tuna-like species in the Convention area and are not registered on the relevant ICCAT list of vessels authorized to fish for tuna and tuna -like species in the ICCAT Convention area; b) Harvest tuna and tuna -like species in the Convention area, and the vessel’s flag State is without quota, catch limit or effort allocation under relevant ICCAT conservation and management measures; c) Do not record or report their catches made in the ICCAT Convention area, or make false reports; d) Take or land undersized fish in contravention of ICCAT conservation measures; e) Fish during closed fishing periods or in closed areas in contravention of ICCAT conservation measures; f) Use prohibited fishing gear or fishing methods in contravention of ICCAT conservation measures; g) Transship or participate in other operations, such as re -supplying or re -fueling, with vessels included in the IUU vessels list; 430 h) Harvest tuna or tuna-like species in the waters under the national jurisdiction of the coastal States in the Convention area without authorization or infringe on that State’s laws and regulations, without prejudice to the sovereign rights of coastal States to take measures against such vessels; i) Are without nationality and fishing or supporting fishing operations in the ICCAT Convention area; and/or j) Engage in fishing or fishing related activities contrary to any other ICCAT conservation and management measures. Information on alleged IUU activities 2. CPCs shall transmit every year to the Executive Secretary, at least 70 days before the annual meeting, information on any vessels presumed to be carrying out IUU fishing activities within the last three years, accompanied by all available supporting eviden ce concerning the presumption of IUU fishing activity and vessel identification information. This information on vessels shall be based on the information collected by CPCs, inter alia , under relevant ICCAT recommendations and resolutions. CPCs shall submit available information on the vessel and the IUU fishing activity in the format attached as Addendum 1 of this Recommendation. Upon receipt of such information, the Executive Secretary shall promptly send this information to all CPCs and to any non-CPC concerned and request that, where appropriate, CPCs and any such non-CPC investigate the alleged IUU activity and/or monitor the vessels. Upon receipt of the notification from the Secretariat, the flag CPC shall, within 60 days, conduct an investigation and submit the investigation report or progress to the Secretariat, which shall immediately circulate it to all CPCs. For the cases circulat ed by the Secretariat that involve activity alleged to have been carried out on the high seas in the ICCAT Convention area, no CPCs shall unilaterally make a determination of IUU fishing on the basis of the initiation of the listing process under this paragraph until the Commission has reviewed the investigation report or progress report, if available, as well as any other information referred to in paragraph 2, 3, 4 and 5, and determined whether or not the vessel has been conducting IUU fishing in accorda nce with this Recommendation. This paragraph shall not affect the rights and obligations of CPCs to take action against IUU fishing activities in accordance with relevant domestic and international law. The Executive Secretary shall request the flag State to notify the owner of the vessel regarding the CPC’s submission of the vessel for its inclusion in the Draft IUU List and of the consequences that may result if it is included on the final IUU Vessel List adopted by the Commission. Development of Draft IUU List 3. On the basis of the information received pursuant to paragraph 2, the ICCAT Executive Secretary shall draw up a Draft IUU List in conformity with Addendum 2 . The ICCAT Executive Secretary shall transmit the Draft IUU List, together with all the information provided, to all CPCs, and to non -CPCs whose vessels are included on these lists, at least 55 days before the annual meeting. CPCs and non - CPCs shall trans mit any comments, including any evidence showing that the listed vessels did not engage in any activity described in paragraph 1, or any actions taken to address such activity, at least 30 days before the annual meeting of ICCAT. Upon receipt of the Draft IUU List, CPCs shall closely monitor the vessels on that List and shall promptly submit to the Secretariat any information they may have related to the vessels’ activities and possible changes of name, flag, call sign or registered owner. Development and adoption of Final IUU List 4. Two weeks in advance of the ICCAT annual meeting, the Executive Secretary shall recirculate to the CPCs and non-CPCs concerned the Draft IUU List, all information received pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3, and any other information obtained by the Executive Secretary. 431 5. CPCs may at any time, and preferably before the annual meeting, submit to the Executive Secretary any additional information that might be relevant for the establishment of the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List. The ICCAT Executive Secretary shall promptly circu late any such additional information to all CPCs and to the non-CPCs concerned. 6. The Permanent Working Group for the Improvement of ICCAT Statistics and Conservation Measures (PWG) shall examine, each year, the Draft IUU List, as well as the information referred to in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5. The results of this examination may, if n ecessary, be referred to the Conservation and Management Measures Compliance Committee. The PWG shall propose to remove a vessel from the Draft IUU List if it determines that: a) The vessel did not take part in any IUU fishing activities described in paragraph 1, or b) i) The flag CPC or non -CPC has adopted measures so that this vessel conforms with ICCAT conservation measures, and ii) The flag CPC or non-CPC has and will continue to assume effectively its responsibilities with respect to this vessel in particular as regards the monitoring and control of the fishing activities executed by this vessel in the ICCAT Convention area, and iii) Effective action has been taken in response to the IUU fishing activities in question, including, inter alia, prosecution and imposition of sanctions of adequate severity, or c) The vessel has changed ownership and that the new owner can establish that the previous owner no longer has any legal, financial or real interests in the vessel or exercises control over it and that the new owner has not participated in IUU fishing. 7. Following the examination referred to in paragraph 6, at each ICCAT annual meeting, the PWG shall develop a Proposed IUU Vessel List, noting which, if any, vessels are proposed for removal from the ICCAT IUU Vessel List adopted at the previous annual meeti ng and the reasons therefor, and submit it to the Commission for adoption as the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List. Actions following adoption of Final IUU Vessel List 8. On adoption of the Final IUU Vessel List, the Executive Secretary shall request CPCs and non -CPCs whose vessels appear on the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List to: − notify the owner of the vessel identified on the Final IUU Vessel List of its inclusion on the list and the consequences which result from being included on the list, as referred to in paragraph 9; − take all the necessary measures to eliminate these IUU fishing activities, including if necessary, the withdrawal of the registration or of the fishing licenses of these vessels, and to inform the Commission of the measures taken in this respect. 9. CPCs shall take all necessary measures, under their applicable legislation to: − ensure that the fishing vessels, support vessels, refuelling vessels, the mother-ships and the cargo vessels flying their flag do not assist in any way, engage in fishing processing operations or participate in any transhipment or joint fishing operations with vessels included on the IUU Vessels List; − ensure that IUU vessels are not authorized to land, tranship, re-fuel, re-supply, or engage in other commercial transactions; prohibit the entry into their ports of vessels included on the IUU list, except in case of force majeure , unless vessels are allowed entry into port for the exclusive purpose of inspection and effective enforcement action; 432 − ensure the inspection of vessels on the IUU list, if such vessels are otherwise found in their ports, to the extent practicable; − prohibit the chartering of a vessel included on the IUU vessels list; − refuse to grant their flag to vessels included in the IUU list, except if the vessel has changed owner and the new owner has provided sufficient evidence demonstrating the previous owner or operator has no further legal, beneficial or financial interest in, or control of, the vessel, or having taken into account all relevant facts, the flag CPC determines that granting the vessel its flag will not result in IUU fishing; − prohibit the import, or landing and/or transhipment, of tuna and tuna -like species from vessels included in the IUU list; − encourage the importers, transporters and other sectors concerned, to refrain from transaction and transhipment of tuna and tuna-like species caught by vessels included in the IUU list; − collect and exchange with other CPCs any appropriate information with the aim of searching for, controlling and preventing false documentation (including import/export certificates) regarding tunas and tuna-like species from vessels included in the IUU list; and − monitor vessels included in the IUU list and promptly submit any information to the Executive Secretary related to their activities and possible changes of name, flag, call sign and/or registered owner. 10. The Executive Secretary will ensure publicity of the Final IUU Vessel List adopted by ICCAT pursuant to paragraph 8, in a manner consistent with any applicable confidentiality requirements, and through electronic means, by placing it, along with any additi onal supporting information on the vessels and IUU activities, on a dedicated portion of the ICCAT website, to be updated as information changes or additional relevant information becomes available. Furthermore, the ICCAT Executive Secretary will transmit the Final IUU Vessel List and supporting information on newly added vessels promptly to other RFMOs for the purposes of enhanced co -operation between ICCAT and these organizations in order to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing. Intersessional modification of ICCAT’s Final IUU Vessel List Incorporation of IUU Vessel Lists of other RFMOs 11. Upon receipt of the final IUU vessel list established by another RFMO 1 and supporting information considered by that RFMO, and any other information regarding the listing determination, such as relevant sections of the RFMO’s meeting report, the Executive Secretary shall circulate this information to the CPCs and to any rele vant non -CPC. Vessels that have been included on the respective lists shall be included on the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List, unless any Contracting Party objects to the inclusion on the Final ICCAT IUU List within 30 days of the date of transmittal by the Executive Secretary on the grounds that: a) there is satisfactory information to establish that: i. The vessel did not engage in the IUU fishing activities identified by the other RFMO, or ii. That effective action has been taken in response to the IUU fishing activities in question, including, inter alia, prosecution, and imposition of sanctions of adequate severity that have been complied with, b) There is insufficient supporting information and other information regarding the listing determination to establish that none of the conditions in sub -paragraph 11a) above have been met. Or 1 The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Inter -American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO), the North -East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO), and the Western and Central Pa cific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). 433 c) In the case of vessels listed by a non-tuna RFMO, there is an insufficient nexus to the conservation and management of ICCAT species to warrant cross-listing. In the event of an objection to a vessel listed by another RFMO being included on the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List pursuant to this paragraph, such vessel shall be placed on the Draft IUU Vessel List and considered by the PWG pursuant to paragraph 6. 12. The ICCAT Executive Secretary shall implement paragraph 11 in accordance with the following procedures: a) The ICCAT Secretariat shall maintain appropriate contacts with the Secretariats of other RFMOs in order to obtain copies of these RFMOs’ IUU vessel lists in a timely manner upon adoption or amendment, including by requesting a copy of these RFMOs’ IUU vess el lists annually upon conclusion of the RFMO’s meeting at which its final IUU list is adopted. b) As soon as possible after adoption or amendment of an IUU vessel list by another RFMO, the ICCAT Secretariat shall collect all supporting documentation available from that RFMO regarding the listing/delisting determinations. c) Once the ICCAT Secretariat has received/collected the information outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b), it shall, consistent with paragraph 11 of this Recommendation, promptly circulate the other RFMO’s IUU vessel list, supporting information, and any other relevant information regarding the listing determination to all CPCs. The requisite circular shall clearly state the reason the information is being provided, explain that ICCAT Contracting Parties have 30 days from the date of the circular to object to the inclusion of the vessels on the ICCAT IUU vessel list, and that absent any such objection the vessel will be added at the expiration of the 30-day period to the Final IUU Vessel List. d) The ICCAT Secretariat shall add any new vessels contained in the other RFMOs’ IUU vessel list to the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List at the end of the 30 -day period provided no objection to such inclusion is received from a Contracting Party pursuant to paragraph 11 of this Recommendation. e) Where a vessel has been included on the ICCAT Final IUU Vessel List solely due to its inclusion on another RFMO’s IUU Vessel List, the ICCAT Secretariat shall immediately remove that vessel from the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List when it has been deleted by the RFMO that originally listed it. f) Upon the addition or deletion of vessels from the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List pursuant to paragraph 11 or 12(e) of this Recommendation, the ICCAT Secretariat shall promptly circulate the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List as amended to all ICCAT CPCs and non-CPCs concerned. Intersessional removal from the Final IUU Vessel List 13. A CPC or non -CPC whose vessel appears on the Final IUU Vessel List that wishes to request the removal of its vessel from the Final IUU Vessel List during the intersessional period shall submit this request to the ICCAT Executive Secretary no later than 15 July of each year accompanied by information to demonstrate that it meets one or more of the grounds for removal specified in paragraph 6. 14. On the basis of the information received by the 15 July deadline, the Executive Secretary will transmit the removal request, with all supporting information to the Contracting Parties within 15 days following receipt of the removal request. 15. The Contracting Parties shall examine the request to remove the vessel and reply within 30 days following the notification by the Executive Secretary if they object to the removal of the vessel from the Final IUU Vessel List. 16. The result of the examination of the request by mail will be checked by the Executive Secretary at the end of the 30-day period following the date of the notification by the Executive Secretary referred to in paragraph 15. 434 If a Contracting Party objects to the removal request, the Executive Secretary shall maintain the vessel on the Final ICCAT IUU List and the removal request shall be forwarded to the PWG for consideration at the annual meeting, if requested by the CPC seeking intersessional removal. If no Contracting Party objects to request to remove the vessel, the Executive Secretary shall promptly remove the vessel concerned from the Final ICCAT IUU Vessel List, as published on the ICCAT website. 17. The Executive Secretary shall promptly communicate the result of the delisting process to all CPCs as well as non-CPCs concerned. Moreover, the ICCAT Executive Secretary shall forward the decision to remove the vessel to other RFMOs. General dispositions 18. This Recommendation shall apply mutatis mutandis to fish processing vessels, tug and towing vessels, vessels engaged in transshipment, and support vessels, and other vessels engaged in fishing related activities managed by ICCAT. 19.

This Recommendation shall be interpreted and applied in conformity with international law, taking into account applicable international rules and standards, including those established through the International Maritime Organization, as well as other international instruments. CPCs shall fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed pursuant to this Recommendation and shall exercise the rights recognized herein in a manner that would not constitute an abuse of right. 3. With a view to monitor compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures, each CPC, in its capacity as a port CPC, shall apply this Recommendation for an effective scheme of port inspections in respect of foreign fishing vessels carrying ICCAT-managed species and/or fish products originating from such species that have not been previously landed, hereinafter refer red to as "foreign fishing vessels". 4. A CPC may, in its capacity as a port CPC, decide not to apply this Recommendation to foreign fishing vessels chartered by its nationals operating under its authority and returning to its port. Such chartered fishing vessels shall be subject to measures by the chartering CPC which are as effectiv e as measures applied in relation to vessels entitled to fly its flag. 5. Without prejudice to specifically applicable provisions of other ICCAT Recommendations, and except as otherwise provided in this Recommendation, this Recommendation shall apply to foreign fishing vessels equal to or greater than 12 meters in length overall. 6. Each CPC shall subject foreign fishing vessels below 12 meters length overall, foreign fishing vessels operating under charter as referred to under paragraph 4, and fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag to measures that are at least as effective in combating IUU fishing as measures applied to vessels referred to in paragraph 3. 7. CPCs shall take necessary action to inform fishing vessels entitled to fly their flag of this and other relevant ICCAT conservation and management measures. Points of Contact 8. Each CPC that grants access to its ports to foreign fishing vessels shall designate a point of contact for the purposes of receiving notifications pursuant to paragraph 13 of this Recommendation. Each CPC shall designate a point of contact for the purpose of receiving inspection reports pursuant to paragraph 35(b) of this Recommendation. Each CPC shall transmit the name and contact information for its points of contact to the ICCAT Secretariat no later than 30 days following the entry into force of this Rec ommendation. Any subsequent changes shall be notified to the ICCAT Secretariat at least 14 days before such changes take effect. The ICCAT Secretariat shall promptly notify CPCs of any such change. 9. The ICCAT Secretariat shall establish and maintain a register of points of contact based on the lists submitted by the CPCs. The register and any subsequent changes shall be published promptly on the ICCAT website. 440 Designated ports 10. Each CPC that grants access to its ports to foreign fishing vessels shall: a) Designate its ports to which foreign fishing vessels may request entry pursuant to this Recommendation; b) Ensure that it has sufficient capacity to conduct inspections in every designated port pursuant to this Recommendation; c) Provide to the ICCAT Secretariat within 30 days from the date of entry into force of this Recommendation a list of designated ports. Any subsequent changes to this list shall be notified to the ICCAT Secretariat at least 14 days before the change takes effect. 11. The ICCAT Secretariat shall establish and maintain a register of designated ports based on the lists submitted by the port CPCs. The register and any subsequent change shall be published promptly on the ICCAT website. 12. Each CPC that does not grant access to its ports to foreign vessels shall so indicate in its Annual Report submitted under Ref. 23-24. Should it subsequently decide to grant access to its ports to foreign fishing vessels, it shall submit the information re quired under paragraphs 8 and 10(c) to the Secretariat at least 14 days before the change takes effect. Advance request for port entry 13. Each port CPC that grants access to its ports to foreign fishing vessels shall require foreign fishing vessels seeking to enter its ports to provide the following information at least 72 hours before the estimated time of arrival at the port: a) Vessel identification (External identification; Name; Flag State; ICCAT Record No., if any; IMO No., if any; and IRCS); b) Name of the designated port, as referred to in the ICCAT register, to which it seeks entry and the purpose of the port call (e.g., resupplying, landing or transshipment); c) Fishing authorization or, where appropriate, any other authorization held by the vessel to support fishing operations on ICCAT species and/or fish products originating from such species, or to transship related fishery products; d) Estimated date and time of arrival in port; e) The estimated quantities in kilograms of each ICCAT species and/or fish products originating from such species held on board, with associated catch areas. If no ICCAT species and/or fish products originating from such species are held on board, a report in dicating that (i.e., a “nil” report) shall be transmitted; f) The estimated quantities for each ICCAT species and/or fish products originating from such species in kilograms to be landed or transshipped, with associated catch areas. The port CPC may also request other information as it may require to determine whether the vessel has engaged in IUU fishing, or related activities. 14. Each CPC shall require any vessels flying its flag that is seeking entry to, or is in, the port of another CPC to: a) comply with obligations implemented by that port CPC pursuant to this Recommendation including obligations for the Master to provide information under paragraph 13; and b) cooperate with the port CPC in inspections carried out pursuant to this Recommendation. 441 15. The port CPC may prescribe a longer or shorter advance notification period than specified in paragraph 13, taking into account, inter alia, the type of fishery products landed in its ports, the distance between the fishing grounds and its ports, and its resources and procedures for considering and verifying the information. In such a case, the port CPC shall inform the ICCAT Secretariat of its advance notification period, and the reasons therefor, within 30 days from the date of entry into force of this Recommendation. Any subsequent changes shall be notified to the ICCAT Secretariat at least 14 days before the change takes effect. Port entry, authorization or denial 16. After receiving the relevant information pursuant to paragraph 13, as well as such other information as it may require to determine whether the foreign fishing vessel requesting entry into its port has engaged in IUU fishing, the port CPC shall decide whether to authorize or deny the entry of the vessel into its port. 17. Without prejudice to paragraph 19, when a CPC has sufficient proof that a foreign fishing vessel seeking entry to its port has engaged in IUU fishing or fishing related activities in support of such fishing the CPC shall deny that vessel entry into its port and shall communicate this decision to the Master of the vessel or its representative. 18. In the event that the port CPC decides to deny the entry of the vessel into its port, it shall so notify the vessel or its representative and shall also communicate the decision to the flag State of the vessel, to the ICCAT Secretariat for posting on the s ecure part of the ICCAT website and, as appropriate and to the extent possible, to relevant coastal States, Regional Fisheries Management Organizations or arrangements (RFMO/As) and other Inter-Governmental Organizations (IGOs). 19. Notwithstanding paragraph 17, a port CPC may allow entry to its port of a vessel referred to in that paragraph exclusively for the purpose of inspecting it and taking other appropriate actions in accordance with international law that are at least as effec tive as denial of port entry in preventing, deterring and eliminating IUU fishing and fishing related activities in support of such fishing. 20. Where a vessel referred to in paragraph 17 is in port for any reason, the port CPC shall deny such vessel the use of its ports for landing, transshipping, packaging, processing and for other port services including, inter alia, refuelling and resupplying, maintenance and dry docking. Paragraph 22 applies mutatis mutandis in such cases. Denial of such use of ports shall be in conformity with international law. Force majeure or distress 21. Nothing in this Recommendation affects the entry of foreign fishing vessels to port in accordance with international law for reasons of force majeure or distress or prevents a port CPC from permitting entry into port to a vessel exclusively for the purpose of rendering assistance to persons, ships or aircraft in danger or distress. Use of ports 22. Where a foreign fishing vessel has entered one of its ports, the port State CPC shall deny, pursuant to its laws and regulations and consistent with international law, including this Recommendation, that vessel the use of the port for landing, transshippin g, packaging, or processing fish that have not been previously landed and for other port services, including, inter alia , refuelling and resupplying, maintenance and dry docking, if: a) The port CPC finds that the vessel does not have a valid and applicable authorization to engage in fishing and fishing related activities in the ICCAT Convention area; b) The port CPC receives clear evidence that the fish on board was taken in contravention of ICCAT conservation and management measures; 442 c) The flag CPC does not confirm within a reasonable period of time, on the request of the port CPC, that the fish on board was taken in accordance with relevant ICCAT conservation and management measures; or d) The port CPC has reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel otherwise engaged in IUU fishing, or fishing related activities in support of such fishing, in the ICCAT Convention area, including in support of a vessel included in ICCAT’s List of Vessels Presumed to Have Carried Out IUU Fishing Activities in the ICCAT Convention Area and other areas , unless the vessel can establish: i. that it was acting in a manner consistent with relevant ICCAT conservation and management measures, ii. in the case of provision of personnel, fuel, gear and other supplies at sea to a vessel on ICCAT’s IUU list, that the vessel that was provisioned was not, at the time of provisioning, included in the ICCAT IUU list. 23. Notwithstanding paragraph 22, the port CPC shall not deny a vessel referred to in that paragraph the use of port services: a) essential to the safety or health of the crew or the safety of the vessel, provided these needs are duly proven, or b) where appropriate, for the scrapping of the vessel. 24. Where a port CPC has denied a vessel the use of its ports, it shall promptly notify the vessel or its representative; the flag State of the vessel; the ICCAT Secretariat, for posting on the secure part of the ICCAT website, and, as appropriate and to the e xtent possible, relevant coastal States, RFMO/As, and other IGOs. 25. A port CPC shall withdraw its denial of the use of its port only if the port CPC is satisfied that there is sufficient proof to show that the grounds on which the use was denied were inadequate or erroneous, or that such grounds no longer apply. 26. Where a port CPC has withdrawn its denial of the use of its port, it shall promptly notify those to whom a notification was issued pursuant to paragraph 24. 27. In case the port CPC decides to authorize the entry of the vessel into its port in accordance with paragraph 19, the provisions set forth in the following section on port inspection shall apply. Port inspections 28. Inspections shall be carried out by properly qualified inspectors of a competent authority of the port CPC. 29. Each year CPCs shall inspect at least 5% of landing and transshipment operations in their designated ports as are made by foreign fishing vessels. 30. In determining which foreign fishing vessels to inspect, the port CPC shall, in accordance with its domestic law, give priority to: a) a vessel that has failed to provide complete and accurate information as required in paragraph 13; b) a vessel that has been denied port entry by another CPC in accordance with this Recommendation; c) requests from other CPCs or relevant RFMO/As that a particular vessel be inspected, particularly where such requests are supported by evidence of IUU fishing, or fishing related activities in support of such fishing, by the vessel in question; 443 d) other vessels for which clear grounds exist for suspecting that a vessel has engaged in IUU fishing or fishing related activities in support of such fishing, including information derived from inspection reports submitted under this scheme and information from other RFMO/As. Inspection procedure 31. Each inspector shall carry a document of identity issued by the port CPC. In accordance with domestic laws, port CPC inspectors shall examine all relevant areas, decks and spaces of the fishing vessel, catches processed or otherwise, nets or other fishing gears, equipment both technical and electronic, records of transmissions and any documents, including fishing logbooks, Cargo Manifests and Mates Receipts and landing declarations in case of transshipment, relevant to verifying compliance with the ICCAT conservation and management measures. They may also question the Master, crew members, or any other person on the vessel being inspected. They may take copies of any documents they consider relevant. 32. In case the vessel is landing or transshipping ICCAT species, inspections shall involve the monitoring of the landing or transshipment and include a cross -check between the quantities by species notified in the prior notification message in paragraph 13 above and held on board. Inspections shall be carried out in such a way that the fishing vessel suffers the minimum interference and inconvenience, and that degradation of the quality of the catch is avoided, to the extent practicable. 33. On completion of the inspection, the port CPC inspector shall provide the Master of the foreign fishing vessel with the inspection report containing the findings of the inspection, including possible subsequent measures that could be taken by the port CPC, to be signed by the inspector and the Master. The Master’s signature on the report shall serve only as acknowledgment of the receipt of a copy of the report. The Master shall be given the opportunity to add any comments or objection to the report, and to contact the competent authority of the flag State, in particular where the Master has serious difficulties in understanding the content of the report. A copy of the report shall be provided to the Master. 34. Flag CPCs shall take necessary action to ensure that Masters facilitate safe access to the fishing vessel, cooperate with the competent authorities of the port CPC, facilitate the inspection and communication and do not obstruct, intimidate or interfere, or cause other persons to obstruct, intimidate or interfere with port CPC inspectors in the execution of their duties. Procedure in the event of apparent infringements 35. If the information collected during the inspection provides evidence that a foreign fishing vessel has committed an infringement of the ICCAT conservation and management measures, the inspector shall: a) record the infringement in the inspection report; b) transmit the inspection report to the port CPC competent authority, which shall, within 14 days following the date of completion of the inspection, forward a copy to the ICCAT Secretariat and to the flag State point of contact and, as appropriate, the rele vant coastal State. If the inspection report cannot be transmitted within 14 days, the port CPC should notify the ICCAT Secretariat within the 14-day time period the reasons for the delay and when the report will be submitted; c) to the extent practicable, ensure safekeeping of the evidence pertaining to such infringement, including original documents where appropriate. If the port CPC refers the infringement to the flag State for further action, the port CPC shall promptly provide the evidence collected to the flag State. 36. Nothing in this Recommendation prevents a port CPC from taking actions that are in conformity with international law in addition to those specified in paragraph 38. The port CPC shall promptly notify the action taken to the flag State, the relevant coastal State, as applicable, and the ICCAT Secretariat, which shall promptly publish this information in the secure part of the ICCAT website. 444 37. Infringements that do not fall within the jurisdiction of the port CPC, and infringements referred to in paragraph 35 for which the port CPC has not taken action, shall be referred to the flag State and, as appropriate, the relevant coastal State. Upon receiving the copy of the inspection report and evidence, the flag CPC shall promptly investigate the infringement and notify the ICCAT Secretariat of the status of the investigation and of any enforcement action that may have been taken within six months of such receipt. If the flag CPC cannot notify the ICCAT Secretariat this status report within six months of such receipt, the flag CPC should notify the ICCAT Secretariat within the six-month time period the reasons for the delay and when the status report w ill be submitted. The ICCAT Secretariat shall promptly publish this information in the secure part of the ICCAT website. CPCs shall include in their Annual Report (Ref. 23-24) information regarding the status of such investigations. 38. Should the inspection provide evidence that the inspected vessel has engaged in IUU activities as referred to in Rec. 18 -08, the port CPC shall deny the vessel the use of port in accordance with paragraph 22, promptly report the case to the flag State, and the relevant coastal CPC, as applicable. The port CPC shall also notify as soon as possible the ICCAT Secretariat that the vessel has engaged in IUU fishing or fishing related activities, and provide supporting evidence. The ICCAT Secretariat shall include the vessel in the Draft IUU list. Annual reporting 39. Port CPCs shall submit each year by 15 September in relation to activity occurring between 1 January and 31 December of the previous year the data listed in Annex 1, in the format to be provided by the Secretariat. The ICCAT Secretariat shall promptly publish this information in the secure part of the ICCAT website. Requirements of developing CPCs 40. CPCs shall give full recognition to the special requirements of developing CPCs in relation to a port inspection scheme consistent with this Recommendation. CPCs shall, either directly or through the ICCAT Secretariat, provide assistance to developing CPCs in order to, inter alia: a) Develop their capacity including by providing technical assistance and funding to support and strengthen the development and implementation of an effective system of port inspection at national, regional and international levels and to ensure that a disproportionate burden resulting from the implementation of this Recommendation is not unnecessarily transferred to them; b) Facilitate their participation in meetings and/or training programmes of relevant regional and international organizations that promote the effective development and implementation of a system of port inspection, including monitoring, control and surveillance, enforcement and legal proceedings for infractions and dispute settlements pursuant to this Recommendation; and c) Either directly or through the ICCAT Secretariat, assess the special requirements of developing CPCs concerning the implementation of this Recommendation. General provisions 41. CPCs are encouraged to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements/arrangements that allow for an inspector exchange programme designed to promote cooperation, share information, and educate each party's inspectors on inspection strategies and methodol ogies which promote compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures. Information regarding such programmes, including a copy of such agreements or arrangements, should be included in Annual Reports of CPCs (Ref. 23-24). 42. Without prejudice to domestic laws of the port CPC, the flag CPC may, in the case of appropriate bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements with the port CPC or at the invitation of that CPC, send its own officials to accompany the inspectors of the port CPC and observe or take part in the inspection of its vessel. 445 43. Flag CPCs shall consider and act on reports of infringements from inspectors of a port CPC on a similar basis as the reports from their own inspectors, in accordance with their domestic laws. CPCs shall cooperate, in accordance with their domestic laws, in order to facilitate judicial or other proceedings arising from inspection reports as set out in this Recommendation. 44. The Commission shall review this Recommendation no later than its 2020 Annual Meeting and consider revisions to improve its effectiveness. 45. This Recommendation repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT on port State measures to prevent, deter and unregulated (IUU) fishing (Rec. 18-09). 446 Annex 1 Data fields for the reporting of port inspections - Number of landings from foreign fishing vessels landing ICCAT species in their ports; - Number of transhipments from foreign fishing vessels transhipping ICCAT species in their ports; - Port denials and withdrawal of denials and the reasons; - Information on the inspections carried out on these vessels in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 29, including: • Date of entry into port • Port • Inspection report number • Flag of vessel • Vessel name • Date of inspection • Infringement reported (Y/N) • Infringement details • Actions taken as a result of the detected infringement • Observations • Reponses from flag State 447 23-18 GEN RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM STANDARDS AND PROGRAMME REQUIREMENTS FOR THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING SYSTEMS (EMS) IN ICCAT FISHERIES (Entry into force 18 June 2024) TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the Resolution by ICCAT for the establishing of an ICCAT Working Group on the use of Electronic Monitoring Systems (WG EMS) (Res. 21-22), and that a primary objective of this Working Group is the establishment of Electronic Monitoring Systems (EMS) minimum standards for ICCAT fisheries; RECOGNIZING that EMS can be used to improve control and constitutes a significant means for authorities to ensure compliance with the applicable rules; FURTHER RECOGNIZING that EMS can enhance the collection of fisheries data for scientific and management purposes; RECALLING the SCRS conclusion that when used for scientific purposes, EMS cannot fully replace human scientific observer programmes, and a minimum human observer’s coverage is still necessary to collect certain information, in particular biological samples; ACKNOWLEDGING that several ICCAT Recommendations currently contemplate the use of EMS, in particular, the Recommendation by ICCAT on a multi -annual conservation and management programme for tropical tunas (Rec. 22 -01), the Recommendation by ICCAT on the conservation of North Atlantic stock of shortfin mako caught in association with ICCAT fisheries (Rec. 21-09) and the Recommendation by ICCAT to establish rebuilding programmes for blue marlin and white marlin/roundscale spearfish (Rec. 19-05). FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that some of these recommendations mandate the establishment of minimum standards for this technology, – standards that must be implemented before EMS can be used to meet certain ICCAT requirements, such as expanded observer coverage; NOTING that the development of EMS minimum programme requirements and technical standards and specifications is fundamental to ensuring both a level playing field among CPCs and that, when these systems are used, they are effective in achieving their intended purpose; FURTHER NOTING that developing CPCs might need technical assistance and capacity building when implementing EMS for ICCAT fisheries; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Purpose and scope 1. The purpose of this recommendation is to establish minimum programme requirements and technical standards and specifications for EMS used in ICCAT longline and purse seine fisheries to meet ICCAT requirements for scientific data collection and/or complian ce monitoring and ensure that when EMS is used it is effective in achieving its intended purpose. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the implementation of EMS is optional, and this recommendation does not create any independent obligation for CPCs to implement EMS on board their fishing vessels. 3. CPCs that implement EMS in their fisheries pursuant to such ICCAT recommendations shall ensure that their EMS domestic programmes meet the minimum programme requirements and standards and specifications set out in this Recommendation. 448 4. Unless otherwise decided by the Commission based on SCRS advice provided pursuant to paragraph 13 of Rec. 16-14, CPCs shall ensure that they continue to meet the human observer coverage required in accordance with paragraph 4 of Rec. 16 -14 and that, if th ey choose to implement EMS in accordance with this Recommendation for scientific purposes, it shall be used to complement the required level of human observer coverage and the required tasks to be performed by these human observers. EMS minimum standards 5. EMS shall automatically and autonomously collect required data for each fishing trip and shall be tamper-evident. 6. EMS shall be capable of collecting data: a) on the position, and, unless the EMS uses cameras that will record continuously, the speed and course of the vessel; b) on starting and ending coordinates and date and time of the setting and haulback operations of each fishing set; c) allowing, where applicable, the estimation of fishing effort (i.e., number of sets, number of hooks); d) allowing the estimation of total catch, including bycatch and discards, per set, and, where possible, the disposition status (i.e., discarded dead, released alive) of discards; e) supporting species identification, and f) allowing, where necessary, for the measurement or estimation of the size of individual fish in the retained catch, including bycatch. 7. Minimum EMS components shall include: - electronic Monitoring (EM) control box/centre, including a satellite positioning system, e.g., the global positioning system (GPS) or equivalent, hereafter referred to as GPS; - video cameras; - sensors or other fishing activity recognition tools, unless system video cameras will run continuously; - battery and data storage backup systems; 8. The minimum technical requirements for an EMS (control box, sensors, and cameras) are detailed in Annex 1. 9. The specific data fields that shall be collected by EMS in longline and purse seine fisheries and those areas of longline and purse seine vessels that shall be subject to coverage by the EMS are listed under Annex 2 and Annex 3 respectively. These annexes also distinguish between the EMS requirements needed for compliance purposes versus scientific data collection purposes. Other Programme requirements Vessel Monitoring Plan (VMP) 10. CPCs shall ensure that a unique Vessel Monitoring Plan (VMP) for each individual vessel flying their flags on which EMS is to be installed is developed that shall allow the installation of the EMS to be adapted to each vessel’s characteristics and describ e how fishing operations on that vessel will be conducted to ensure effective monitoring of fishing activities onboard. The VMP shall cover all relevant minimum standards and technical specifications in this Recommendation while optimizing the quality of data the EMS collects from the vessel. A copy of the approved VMP shall be maintained aboard the vessel at all times during fishing operations. The VMP requirements are detailed in Annex 4. Data management 11. The requirements applicable to CPCs for data storage and retention, data transmission or retrieval and data review and reporting are detailed in Annex 5. 449 Obligations of the vessel Master 12. The Master of the vessel shall ensure that: - the vessel does not leave port if the EMS is not operating properly unless, the flag CPC authorizes it to do so and ensures that any relevant data collection or other ICCAT obligations, such as minimum observer coverage requirements, can be met through other means; - in case the EMS malfunctions, report the malfunction, including the display of any critical warning, to the flag CPC competent authorities, through automatic real time notification of the malfunction or manually, within a maximum of 24 hours or as soon as practicable; - on-board physical access to the EMS components is provided if requested by an ICCAT or CPC - authorized observer and/or inspection personnel; - in accordance with the VMP and the minimum areas of vessel coverage as specified in Annexes 2 and 3, the cameras have an un -obstructed view, and following pre -established protocols, the camera lenses are kept clean; - the handling of the catch does not hinder the proper identification and estimation of the catch composition by the EMS, including by-catch; - the transmission or retrieval of EMS data is carried out in accordance with the provisions of Annex 5; - unless authorized and instructed by the flag CPC to take a specific action, the EMS is not tampered with (e.g., disconnect the system, rearrange, or obstruct the view of the cameras, disconnect cameras or sensors, switch-off the EMS manually, intentionally break the system, etc.). Obligations of the flag CPC 13. CPCs that choose to implement EMS to meet ICCAT requirements specified in separate ICCAT recommendations (e.g., regarding observer coverage), shall ensure that the fishing vessels flying their flags meet the EMS minimum standards and requirements establish ed in this Recommendation, including ensuring the following: - that domestic EMS programmes are developed, and designed and implemented in a manner that ensures they are independent, transparent, and accountable, in accordance with requirements set out in this Recommendation; - that the analysis of the EMS data is done by CPC -authorized independent companies or by CPC institutions or CPC authorities, with the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities to ensure effective data analysis, including sufficiently accurate species identification; - that rules and procedures are established in case of EMS failure, including to ensure that any relevant data collection or other ICCAT obligations, such as minimum observer coverage requirements, can be met through other means; - that appropriate follow -up is undertaken if potential infringements of ICCAT conservation and management measures are detected through the CPC’s EMS programme. 14.

(Note: need for cameras in specific positions to cover all areas where specimens are released). Discard – Condition at the time of discarding (*) Condition of the specimens that are discarded. Current ICCAT codes are: Alive; Dead; Unknown. (Note: The EMS would need cameras or other systems in specific positions to determine specimen condition at release. It would also require video and not only still images, to determine if the specimens are alive/swimming when released). 5. Biological data (optional) Species Species FAO Code. Sex (*) Sex of the specimens. (Note: might be possible to collect for elasmobranchs with specific specimen position by the crew and cameras).

Released (Y/N) Record if the specimen was released (Yes/No) (Note: for specimens discarded in the water the operation is visualized by filming the surrounding water. It is not always possible to reach species level in such cases and might be needed to only report at the level of genus or family. For specimens that are hoisted to the vessel (e.g., to remove the hooks), it should be possible to record the species level in most cases. External injuries (scale) (*) Injuries of the specimens that are released. Injury scale used at ICCAT: Unknow (undetermined); Alive: Perfect (no visual injuries); Alive: Moderate (superficial injuries); Alive: Severe (could affect survival); Dead (release).

If other measures are used, need to specify in notes. 4. Catch composition by fishing operation Species Species FAO Code (Note: normally it is possible to collect species-specific identification, but there could be difficulties in identifying specimens at species- specific level in some groups during purse seine operations. High-resolution cameras should improve species identification. For some taxonomic groups (e.g., turtles) the crew could be required to place the specimens in designated areas (e.g., calibrated areas) that would improve species identification and allow taking additional information as sizes and condition). Targeted (Y/N) (*) Specify if the species is targeted or not. (Note: this field likely needs integration with additional information from logbooks and/or the skipper). Catches retained - Weight Catches by species that are retained in weight and numbers. Report of retained catch data in weight is mandatory, and in numbers is optional. (Notes: technical data as total brail capacity and wells capacity should be known previously for each vessel. EMS trials have tried to estimate species composition by set, but mostly without consistent results to date. It is noted that human observers have the same difficulty when estimating species composition in purse seine operations, due to the large catch volumes that can result in a set, and the speed with which the fish are put into the wells. As such, for retained catch by species, Catches retained - Number (*) 461 it might be necessary to integrate with additional information from logbooks and/or port-sampling. Artificial intelligence applied on the conveyor belt has been showing preliminary promising results so such methods might be increasingly applied in the future). Product type Product type that the weight of the retained catches refers to. Examples currently used to report to ICCAT are: Live (round) weight; Gilled & gutted; Fillet; Dressed weight; Belly meat; Other (specify it in notes). Discards – Number Number of specimens that are discarded. Should be reported by species, if possible, or alternatively for higher taxonomic groups (e.g., genus or family) if not possible to detect the species. (Note: In purse seine operations, specimens can be released in various areas, so it will be necessary to either have more cameras or require that the releases are always done in the same place, although there may be logistic difficulties. Observers also face similar difficulties, as they cannot monitor the main and wells' decks simultaneously). Discard – Condition at the time of discarding (*) Condition of the specimens that are discarded. Current ICCAT codes are: Alive; Dead; Unknown. (Note: Discards of tunas in purse seines are usually composed of dead discards and might be estimated. The condition of other discarded species (e.g., sharks) might be doubtful). 5.FAD activities Type/structure Type of floating object (flotsam, natural object, FAD). FAD activity: deployment Date, time (hh:mm and YYYY/MM/DD) and position when the FAD is deployed. FAD activity: visit Date, time (hh:mm and YYYY/MM/DD) and position when the FAD is visited. FAD activity: hauling Date, time (hh:mm and YYYY/MM/DD) and position when the FAD is hauled. FAD activity: retrieving Date, time (hh:mm and YYYY/MM/DD) and position when the FAD is retrieved. FAD ID (*) When possible and if FAD is marked. Buoy ID (*) When possible. For every activity involving FADs equipped with a buoy (i.e., buoy marking or any information allowing identifying the owner). 6. Biological data (optional) Species Species FAO code. (Note: normally it is possible to collect species-specific ID, but there could be difficulties in reaching the species level in some species groups. High-resolution cameras should improve species identification. For some taxonomic groups (e.g., turtles) and when they are brought onboard, the crew could be required to place the specimens in designated areas (e.g., calibrated areas) that would improve species identification and allow taking additional information as size and condition). Sex (*) Sex of the specimens (Male/Female/Unknown). (Note: handling bycatch in purse seine operations is complex as the bycatch can be processed in several different places onboard. The sex of the specimens might in some cases be observed for elasmobranchs and turtles (visible externally). Additional cameras would be needed in specific and various places where bycatch is released. For the target tunas it is not possible to collect sex information (no external characters) with either human observers or EMS). Length (cm) (*) Size of the specimens (cm). (Notes: retained specimens are passed through one specific area (i.e., conveyor belt) so it could be possible to have a calibrated area defined for taking size samples. For discarded specimens, as they can be released in various areas, it would be necessary to either have more cameras or require that the releases are always done in the same place, although there may be logistical difficulties). Size class type (*) Codes for the size class type reported in the length (cm) field. Current codes used in ICCAT are: Straight fork length, Curved Fork Length, Lower Jaw to 1st Dorsal Length, Straight lower jaw fork length, Curved lower jaw fork length, Posterior edge of eye socket to Fork Length, Total length, Other (specify it in notes). 462 Weight (kg) (*) Weight of the specimens (Kg). (Note: both human observers and EMS can only take individual weights in vessels that have scales. Most vessels don't have these onboard. If the vessels have scales then the human observers can take weights directly. For EMS, it might be possible to put cameras facing the scales, or there might be a way to connect the scales to the EMS directly). Product weight and product type (*) Product type that the weight of the individual specimens refers to. Examples currently used to report to ICCAT are: Live (round) weight; Gilled & gutted; Fillet; Dressed weight; Belly meat; Other (specify it in notes). (Note: similarly to the catches retained in Weight, this field might be possible to collect only in vessels that have scales, either with the adaptation of cameras facing the scales, or connecting the scales to the EMS directly). Released (Y/N) Record if the specimen was released (Yes/No). (Notes: Discarded specimens in purse seine operations can be released in various areas, so it might be necessary to either have more cameras or require that the releases are always done in the same place, although there may be logistical difficulties). External injuries (scale) (*) Condition and injuries of the specimens that are released. Injury scale used at ICCAT: Unknow (undetermined); Alive: Perfect (no visual injuries); Alive: Moderate (superficial injuries); Alive: Severe (could affect survival); Dead (release). (Notes: discards of tunas are usually composed of dead discards. The condition and injuries of other discarded species (e.g., sharks, turtles) can be doubtful). (*) Items marked with an asterisk reflect ST-09 data fields that may not be possible to collect through EMS without specific system or fish handling adaptations. In the absence of such adaptations, these data should be collected and reported through human observer programmes or other appropriate means. 463 Annex 4 Description of the Vessel Monitoring Plan (VMP) The VMP shall meet the following conditions: 1. The VMP shall be developed for each vessel on which EMS is to be installed and shall be delivered to the flag CPC competent authorities. 2. The VMP shall be developed in collaboration with the EMS service provider, vessel owner and relevant CPC fishing authorities. 3. A survey of the vessel to be fitted with EMS shall be carried out by the EMS provider and/or CPC fishing authorities and the following factors shall be taken into consideration in the development of the VMP, with a view to ensuring the system meets the min imum data collection requirements laid out in Annex 2 or 3: a) Camera positioning and settings. b) Number of cameras to be installed to ensure optimization of the view of the catch-handling area. c) Key areas to be surveyed are catch handling areas for species identification and storage of the individuals and areas of discards or release. 4. The minimum sections to be contained in a VMP are: - Contact information: current contact information for the vessel owner, vessel operator and EMS service provider as long as the contract lasts. - General vessel information: basic information about the vessel and its fishing activities and operations (e.g., vessel name, registration number, target fishery, areas, fishing gear, LOA, etc.). - Vessel layout: equipment of the vessel with detailed information, plan of the vessel disposition and different areas (deck, processing, storage, etc.). - EMS equipment set up: description of the settings of the EMS, such as time running, number of cameras, settings of the cameras (frame rate and resolution), and areas covered, time recording for each of the cameras, number of sensors, where applicable, soft ware used, control box disposition, etc. - Catch handling procedures: description of the crew and their operations. - A shot and image taken by each camera shall be inserted in the VMP. 5. Any physical changes on the vessel, fishery, categorization of the vessel (fleet segmentation), catch handling deck, etc., shall be reported to the Flag CPC authorities, and the VMP should be updated accordingly before the next fishing trip. 6. The VMP shall be signed off by the vessel owner and approved by the Flag CPC competent authority. 7. The EMS equipment shall not adversely affect vessel stability by posing risk to vessel operations, crew, or environment, nor shall it impede the vessel’s safe navigation. An example template of a VMP is detailed in Appendix 1. CPCs may choose another template of a VMP. 464 Annex 5 Data management Data storage and retention EM service/technology providers and EM analyst shall treat as confidential all information with respect to the fishing operations of the vessel and accept this requirement in writing. Standards for where, how, and how long video footage will be stored after it has been reviewed, shall be specified in the EMS domestic programmes. Storage decisions shall be based on the EM programme’s goals and the personnel who will need to access monitoring records, at what frequency, and for what purpose. Once footage is reviewed, it shall be stored for at least 3 years, except if national data retention regulations require a shorter period. When the system is to be used for enforcement purposes, the data collected by the EMS shall be stored for as long as necessary until the possible infringement proceedings have been finalized. EMS shall have sufficient autonomy and capacity to safeguard and store all recorded images and, where appropriate, sensor information for at least the duration of a complete fishing trip. EMS records shall have an output format that is compatible with the standardized electronic codes list developed by the SCRS to ensure collected information is consistent with current ICCAT data reporting requirements. EMS video records shall contain at least the following information: the vessel name and vessel ID and trip ID, camera number, geolocation data (date, time (UTC), latitude and longitude), sensor data where appropriate, camera recording status and EM system status, where available, and images. Data transmission or retrieval When EMS records are retrieved by extracting the memory device or when a memory device is replaced between trips, traceability of every memory device and information recorded on board shall be guaranteed. The chain of custody of the EMS memory device shall be assured. A detailed protocol on how to retrieve the data from the vessel to the authorities or to the data analyst shall be detailed and agreed on the vessel monitoring plan by both the vessel owner, the respective authorities. When EMS records are transmitted (via WI -FI, mobile data network or satellite), the transmission of the data shall be done at the end of the fishing trip where possible. If not possible the data shall be securely stored and transmitted without delay/at the earliest opportunity. This type of transmission shall ensure proper encrypted data, when required/decided by national authorities. Data review and reporting The EMS shall have dedicated software to assist in data review. This software shall permit the analysis of all the stored data, images, and sensor data where appropriate, in a synchronized way. CPCs shall ensure that data analysis procedures ensure good traceability and effective analysis of data. At a minimum, analysis software shall allow for the report of the following: - identification of fishing operations date/time; - identification of set type; - estimation of the catch by set, including bycatch; - estimation of species catch composition and sizes; - estimation of discards or release species, and its condition; - FAD deployment (for purse seine vessels). 465 The CPC shall appoint analysts that have the following qualifications to accomplish their responsibilities: a) Sufficient knowledge and experience to understand relevant fishing operations and catch handling, identify species, and collect information on different fishing activities. In this regard, previous at sea observer experience is valuable. b) Satisfactory knowledge of the ICCAT conservation and management measures if the EMS domestic programme is being used for compliance monitoring purposes. c) The ability to use properly the dedicated analysis software and observe and record accurately data to be collected under the programme. d) Not be an employee of a fishing vessel company involved in the observed fishery or have other direct conflicts of interest. When EMS is used for scientific data collection purposes, CPCs shall submit relevant data to ICCAT in a format that is compatible with (1) any data collected and reporting pursuant to their domestic scientific observer programmes (including observer’s data bases), as well as (2) ICCAT data reporting requirements and templates for data submission. When the EMS is to be used for compliance monitoring purposes, data analysis shall be based on risk assessment. Taking into account ICCAT recommendations that authorize or require the use EMS to monitor compliance with certain conservation and management measures, CPCs shall provide a list of relevant ICCAT measures for which it is using EMS for this purpose, to CPC appointed analysts. Each CPC shall establish a protocol for reporting and following up on potential infringements of ICCAT requirements detected using EMS. 466 Appendix 1 Example Template of a Vessel Monitoring Plan (VMP) This example is not binding and is provided only for reference purposes Part A (Shall be handed over by the vessel owner) 1.

GENERAL RULES 1. All at-sea transhipment operations: a) within the Convention area of tuna and tuna-like species and other species caught in association with these species; and b) outside the Convention area of tuna and tuna-like species and other species caught in association with these species that were harvested in the ICCAT Convention area; are prohibited, except that LSPLVs, defined as those greater than 24 meters length overall, may conduct at -sea transhipment under the programme established in Section 3 below. All other transhipments must take place in port. 2. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (hereafter referred to as CPCs) shall take the necessary measures to ensure that vessels flying their flag comply with the obligations set out in Appendix 3 when transhipping tuna and tuna -like species and other species caught in association with these species in port. 3. CPCs shall prohibit their vessels from taking part in transhipment activities if any of the vessels involved are included in the ICCAT IUU Vessel List including vessels listed by ICCAT on the basis of listings by other relevant Regional Fisheries Manageme nt Organizations and Arrangements (RFMO/As). 4. This Recommendation does not apply to harpoon vessels engaged in the transhipment of fresh swordfish1 at sea. 1 For the purpose of this Recommendation, “fresh swordfish” means swordfish that are alive, whole or gutted / dressed but not further processed or frozen. 482 5. This Recommendation does not apply to transhipments outside the Convention area where such transhipment is subject to a comparable monitoring programme established by another Regional Fisheries Management Organization. 6. This Recommendation is without prejudice to additional requirements applicable to transhipment at sea or in port in other ICCAT Recommendations. SECTION 2. RECORD OF CARRIER VESSELS AUTHORISED TO RECEIVE TRANSHIPMENTS 7. Transhipment of tuna and tuna-like species and other species caught in association with these species may only be authorized with regard to carrier vessels authorized in accordance with this Recommendation. Carrier vessels are those vessels used for fish transport. A CPC shall only authorize its carrier vessels to engage in transhipment under this Recommendation if the vessel has an International Maritime Organization (IMO) number and the CPC is satisfied with its ability to monitor the vessel’s compliance with the requirements of this Recommendation. 8. An ICCAT Record of Carrier Vessels authorized to receive tuna and tuna-like species and other species caught in association with these species in the Convention area shall be established. For the purposes of this Recommendation, carrier vessels not entered on the record are deemed not to be authorized to receive tuna and tuna -like species and other species caught in association with these species in transhipment operations. 9. A vessel may not simultaneously be authorized as a carrier vessel and a fishing vessel. 10. In order for its carrier vessels to be included on the ICCAT Record of Carrier Vessels, a flag CPC or flag Non-Contracting Party (NCP) shall submit each calendar year, electronically, and in the format specified by the ICCAT Executive Secretary, a list of the carrier vessels flying its flag that are authorized to receive transhipments in the Convention area. All vessels included on the ICCAT Record of Carrier Vessels must be flagged to a CPC, except for those carrier vessels flagged to an NCP that app eared on the Record on 18 November 2024; replacement of an NCP carrier vessel with another of the same flag shall be allowed. The list shall include the following information: - Name of vessel, register number - ICCAT Record Number (if any) - IMO number - Previous name (if any) - Previous flag (if any) - Previous details of deletion from other registries (if any) - International radio call sign - Type of vessels, length, gross registered tonnage (GRT) and carrying capacity - Name and address of owner(s) and operator(s) - For carrier vessels, type of transhipment authorised (i.e. in port and/or at sea) - Time period authorised for transhipping 11. Each CPC shall promptly notify the ICCAT Executive Secretary of any changes to the ICCAT Record of Carrier Vessels, at any time such changes occur. 12. The ICCAT Executive Secretary shall maintain the ICCAT Record and take measures to ensure its publicity through electronic means, including placing it on the ICCAT website, in a manner consistent with domestic confidentiality requirements. 13. CPCs shall prohibit their LSPLVs from transhipping any tuna and tuna -like species and other species caught in association with these species with vessels not entered on the ICCAT Record of Carrier Vessels. 14. Vessels without an IMO number shall not be included in the ICCAT Record of Authorized Carrier Vessels and shall be prohibited from engaging in transhipment activities. 483 SECTION 3. PROGRAMME TO MONITOR AND CONTROL TRANSHIPMENT ACTIVITIES Vessel monitoring systems 15. Carrier vessels authorized for transhipment shall be required to install and continuously operate a VMS in accordance with all applicable ICCAT recommendations, including the Recommendation by ICCAT concerning minimum standards for vessel monitoring systems in the ICCAT Convention area (Rec. 18-10), or any successor recommendation related to VMS minimum standards, including any future revisions thereto. Port inspection 16. Consistent with the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 18 -09 on Port State measures to prevent, deter, and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (Rec. 23-17), port CPCs should prioritize inspection in port of a) carrier vessels whose VMS signals disappear under suspicious circumstances and without explanation and/or indicate dubious movements, and b) carrier vessels not entered into the ICCAT Record of Carrier Vessels to verify ICCAT species are not on board. Inspection of transhipment activities in port should involve the monitoring of the entire transhipment process and include a cross check of transhipped amounts by species as reported in the fishing vessel’s logbook and review of the prior authorization to tranship in por t issued by the flag CPC to the fishing vessel. Separation of cargo 17. Carrier vessels authorized to receive transhipments of ICCAT species shall be required to retain a copy of documentation required by paragraph 22 of this Recommendation from each fishing vessel, to separate and stow transhipped fish by fishing vessel, and develop a stowage plan to show the locations in the hold of the quantities by species and vessel. The carrier vessel master shall submit the fishing vessel documentation and stowage plan to inspectors, if requested. Large Scale Pelagic Longline Vessels (LSPLVs) authorized to tranship at sea 18. At sea transhipment by LSPLVs for tuna and tuna-like species and other species caught in association with these species may only be authorized in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section, in Section 4, and Appendix 1 and 2 below. 19. Each flag CPC that authorizes its LSPLVs to tranship at sea shall submit each calendar year electronically and in the format specified by the Executive Secretary, the list of its LSPLVs that are authorized to tranship at sea.

The Commission shall communicate with other relevant regional fishery management bodies which established the statistical document programs and the authorized vessel records and request them to implement the similar reforms. 1 Note from the Secretariat: The amended forms and instruction sheets have been appended to the relevant Recommendations and Resolutions, the Resolution by ICCAT Concerning the Effective Implementation of the ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Program [Ref. 94-05], the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the Implementation of the ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Program on Re-export [Ref. 97-04], the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the ICCAT Bigeye Tuna Statistical Document Program [Ref. 01-21] and the Recommendation by ICCAT Establishing a Swordfish Statistical Document Program [Ref. 01-22]. 2 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 09-08, 11-12, 13-13 and 21-14 522 06-16 SDP RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON AN ELECTRONIC STATISTICAL DOCUMENT PILOT PROGRAM (Entry into force: June 13, 2007) RECALLING that ICCAT’s Working Group to Review Statistical Monitoring Programs concluded that improved implementation of the statistical document programs is warranted, RECOGNIZING the developments in electronic information exchange and the benefits of rapid communication with regard to the processing and management of ICCAT’s statistical document programs, and NOTING that electronic systems could improve the ICCAT statistical document programs through expediting cargo handling, increasing the ability to detect fraud and deter IUU shipments, facilitating more efficient exchange of information between exporting and impo rting parties, and encouraging automated links between national catch reporting and customs processing systems, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities and Fishing Entities (CPCs), to the extent they are able, should develop pilot projects to investigate the feasibility of electronic systems to improve the statistical document programs , consistent with their national laws. Pilot projects shall contain all of the information elements of the current paper systems and have the ability to produce paper copies upon request of national authorities from the exporting and importing parties. 2. CPCs implementing a pilot electronic system shall coordinate with importing and exporting partners prior to the proposed effective date of the pilot system to ensure that the electronic system meets the current requirements of the ICCAT statistical docume nt programs, taking into consideration the respective national regulations of the importing and exporting parties and the need for electronic means of authenticating transactions and users of the system. The pilot electronic system should be flexible enough to accommodate any agreed changes to ICCAT’s programs in the future. 3. CPCs implementing a pilot electronic statistical document program shall continue to accept valid paper documents from exporting parties, and issue paper documents to importing parties, for all such parties unable to participate in the pilot program and for all participating parties upon notification of either party. 4. A description of the pilot electronic system and details of its implementation shall be provided to the Secretariat for distribution to all parties. Parties taking part in the pilot program shall report observations on the advantages and problems, if any, to the Commission. 523 10-11 SDP RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON AN ELECTRONIC BLUEFIN TUNA CATCH DOCUMENT PROGRAMME (eBCD) (Entry into force: June 14, 2011) TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the multi -annual recovery plan for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna. RECOGNIZING the developments in electronic information exchange and the benefits of rapid communication with regard to the processing and management of catch information. NOTING the ability of electronic catch documentation systems to detect fraud and deter IUU shipments and the creation of automated links between Parties including exporting and importing authorities. RECOGNIZING the necessity to develop and strengthen the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation by the implementation of an electronic document system. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: An electronic Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation System (eBCD) shall be developed and maintained at the ICCAT Secretariat covering all bluefin tuna caught, farmed, harvested and traded. The technical specifications of the eBCD system along the lines of the concepts presented in the enclosed document together with full details of its implementation shall be developed by the Secretariat in collaboration with CPCs through the formation of an eBCD Working Group. This Working Group shall meet throughout 2011 and discuss in detail which elements shall be developed by the Secretariat, based on their experience and management of other databases such as the ICCAT Record of Vessels, and those that will need to be undertaken by outsourced technical services. On this basis the development and testing of the system will proceed under the guidance of the Working Group so as to be completed prior to the 2011 annual meeting. The Recommendation by ICCAT Amending Recommendation 08 -12 on an ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation Program [Rec. 09-11] shall then be amended at the 2011 annual meeting so that the eBCD system is fully operational by 1 March 2012. 524 The Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation (BCD) Programme – The way forward through the development of an electronic BCD system (eBCD) 1. Background As part of the measures to sustainably manage eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna, improve the quality and reliability of statistical data and prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, ICCAT adopted in 2007 a catch documentation programme for bluefin tuna entitled the blue-fin catch document (BCD) which must accompany bluefin tuna products from catch to trade. Each BCD is composed of different sections (catch, transfer, farming, harvesting, trade) which must each be completed by concerned operators and subsequently validated by their flag and/or farm States. By validating, flag State authorities confirm that the products referred to each section of the BCD have been caught and transferred in accordance with appropriate conservation and management measures. The programme has, however, suffered from a number of shortcomings which have been discussed during the 2009 ICCAT annual meeting as well as the 2010 intersessional Compliance Committee, which if not improved could weaken the management of E-BFT particularly within the purse seine and farming sectors. In light of the discussions at the Second Joint Meeting of Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations in San Sebastian, Spain, in 2009 which concluded that minimum standards or best practices for catch document systems should be adopted, and in the c ontext of the draft recommendation for an electronic catch document pilot programme proposed by the Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures in Madrid, Spain in February 2010, the framework in ICCAT for technological developments to the BCD programme are well founded. 2. Current situation The BCD programme is currently 100% paper based with validation authorities, seals, signatures and numbers provided by flag CPC authorities and registered with ICCAT. A number of sections must be completed by operators while others by the competent validating authorities. The provisions of ICCAT Recommendation [09 -11] require a copy of a BCD to be sent to the ICCAT Secretariat by the CPC authorities within five days of validation. The EU considers the main problems associated with the programme to date include, but are not limited to: (1) Delays in validation Issues have been observed in the validation procedures associated with the relevant sections of the BCD. This concerns both delays in validation as well as the order in which the validations have taken place. (2) Traceability This specifically relates to where there have been variations in the numbers of individual eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna throughout the supply chain, particularly the case in live trade and split shipments (lots). (3) Security / confidentiality of information The lack of real-time centralisation of information cannot safeguard its integrity and confidentiality. (4) Errors and unreadable entries There are also cases, often due to faxed or scanned copies, where the entries have become unreadable and impossible to verify. Alternatively, there are cases where data has been entered incorrectly and/or in the wrong field. 525 3. The way forward In light of recent developments in electronic information exchange, processing and management it is clear that electronic systems can improve the BCD Programme through the treatment of shipments (lots), the ability to detect fraud and deter IUU shipments and the facilitation of automated links between the various actors involved including exporting and importing authorities. Alongside the deficiencies in the Programme, there is therefore the need through technological advances to strengthen and further develop the BCD Programme. An electronic BCD system should be developed and maintained at the ICCAT Secretariat to ensure the legitimacy of actions and data related to the programme which will also facilitate enhanced monitoring and control at the critical control points. 4. Technical overview of the eBCD system An electronic BCD system (eBCD) should involve a central database at the ICCAT Secretariat that can only be accessed by secure web -based technology by each respective 'actor 1' involved in the catching, farming, harvesting and trading of bluefin tuna. The online BCD form used by each actor will have the same appearance and be completed in the same way as the paper version. The rights and obligations of each actor will be strictly related to their role in the BCD Programme by way of secured access or administrative rights, i.e. such that a validating authority can only validate, while a fisherman can only enter catch data. The access to the system will be based on standard technology and users need only have an internet connection (with the required security installed). Alternatively, the system should be able to receive data automatically provided by catch information systems in the CPCs, for example systems managing electronic logbook data. The system will be progressive in accordance with the known traceability of bluefin tuna, so for example the farming section cannot be filled in before the catch section is completed and subsequently validated. See Figure 1, which represents the basic flow of information and involvement of the different 'actors' within the BCD Programme. The system can be customised for error and/or non-compliance prevention, so for example catch can only be recorded weighing between 8 and 500 kgs can be entered or catch can not be validated in a closed season / area. The system should be linked with other ICCAT information sources such as the Record of Vessels, so that only those vessels authorised and active can report a catch. Likewise, other sources like the VMS Registry or the list of Joint Fishing Operation repartition keys could be linked to the eBCD system. As there is a requirement for the BCD to follow the fish, it can be envisaged for a user to print out and display the BCD number and/or barcode on a shipment/lot. This BCD number barcode identifier could then be cross-checked by an inspector, who need only log onto to the secure ICCAT website. The compliance aspects / features should be further discussed between CPCs (e.g. prior authorisations could be dealt with by the system). 1 'Actors' refer to operators (fisherman, farms) and/or their representatives and validating authorities. 526 An important element of the system will be dedicated to managing the user accounts with the login name, password, contact details and/or security certificate. Every actor should receive one or more user accounts associated to their rights in the eBCD system. Every CPC shall manage the user accounts dedicated to them. For the actors themselves, they will obtain the necessary information and/or security certificate from the system in order to start using the eBCD system simply with a default internet connection and web browser. Account details and security certificates will also need to be implemented for automatic data exchange, for which the uniform data exchange format needs to be developed. Figure 1. Basic flowchart of BCD sections with related actors. 5. Example actions and related actors: Each 'action' in the system has different applications, each of which has its own actor's specific to it. Below are a number of example actions: - Validating: after the completion of the catching, farming, trading and harvesting sections, a validating authority must validate the content before the eBCD can pass to the next actor. - Inserting a new quantity into the system: can only be done by fishermen or trap owners which by doing so generates a new BCD and unique BCD ID number. 1.

TradeImporter/Buyer ValidationGovernment 527 - Transmitting: actors like transfer vessels or transport companies cannot amend the entries relating to the quantities of bluefin tuna reported caught, but only complete transmit them to the next actor. Farming is a specific case as the number of individuals will remain equal while the weight increases. - Splitting: Includes fish processing so the catch is split in different products, also splitting of shipments for different trade destinations. - Combining: contrary to splitting, several batches of tuna could be combined into one before continuing the trade. - Exiting: usually when the fish is sold on the market, it exits from the eBCD chain and becomes inactive nonetheless the data remains on the eBCD database. The system should also have an 'alerting' function, such that each actor is alerted by means of an email which will direct them (URL link) to the eBCD system. 6. Advantages of the eBCD system The electronic system will manage all aspect of the eBCD programme, also the printed BCD numbers which accompany the fish. In general the eBCD system will look to improve the following: - Copying, scanning, emailing etc. - Delays in sending BCDs for validation - Errors and poor quality entries - Encoding of BCD data (within CPCs or by Secretariat) - Non-compliance - Administrative burden. As mentioned, the system could be further expanded for control purposes and allow connections with other systems. 7. Way forward The EU proposes that a system be discussed and agreed with a view to developing system specification and/or minimum standards, which could assist the Secretariat in the development of the system. External technical services may also be needed for some aspects of system development. Following the agreement of the Commission, the Recommendation by ICCAT Amending the Recommendation 08-12 on an ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation Program [Rec. 09-11] will then be revisited at the 2011 annual meeting with a view to incorporating the eBCD system. Given the time required for the development and testing it is realistic to envisage the system being operational in 2012. It would be more appropriate to have a n instantaneous switch -over as opposed to a phased approach, consequently 1 March 2012 would be a suitable date for the system to go online as this date in the context of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna Recovery Plan this represents the beginning of the campaign (submission date for authorised vessel lists, annual fishing plans). The ICCAT Secretariat shall therefore establish an ICCAT eBCD system so as to be fully operational by 1 March 2012. 528 12-09 SDP RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON A PROCESS TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CATCH CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR TUNA AND TUNA-LIKE SPECIES (Entry into force: June 10, 2013) RECOGNIZING the impact that market factors have on the fishery; CONCERNED by the impact that illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing has in the ICCAT Convention area; REITERATING the responsibilities of flag States to ensure that their vessels conduct their fishing activities in a responsible manner, fully respecting ICCAT conservation and management measures; NOTING the need for improved and strict control on all the components involved in the tuna and tuna-like species fisheries; UNDERLINING the complementary role that importing States also have in the control of the catches of tuna and tuna-like species to ensure compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures; RECALLING ICCAT’s statistical document program for bigeye tuna and swordfish and their objectives; RECOGNIZING that properly tracing tuna and tuna-like species from the point of capture to their final import has significant operational and technical aspects that would need to be addressed for any effective catch certification scheme; COMMITTED to taking steps that conform with international law, notably as regards the World Trade Organization (WTO), and to ensure that tuna and tuna -like species entering markets of Contracting and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) of ICCAT and non -members of ICCAT is caught in the Convention area in a manner that does not diminish the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures; CONSIDERING the discussions on traceability system in the 7 th Meeting of the Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures (hereinafter referred to as the 7th IMM WG), THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. The next meeting of the Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures i n 2013 shall address technical and practical issues associated with the development of a Catch Certificate Scheme for tuna and tuna-like species, taking into consideration Appendix 3 of the Report on the 7th IMM WG and taking into account the following factors: i) The conservation status of ICCAT species/stocks; ii) Monitoring and control measures currently in place, including catch and trade tracking programs, and their effectiveness and utility; iii) Which species, stocks, ocean areas, and/or fisheries would most benefit from additional monitoring and control measures, and which approaches or tools, including catch certification schemes, could best be used to enhance the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures; iv) How ICCAT fisheries are conducted (e.g., fishing grounds, gear types, transshipment activities, harvesting CPCs, etc); v) The ways in which products from ICCAT fisheries are processed, transported, and traded; vi) The overall level of trade by species and product type as well as the CPCs and non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (NCPs) involved; 529 vii) Operational issues, capacity requirements, and costs associated with various monitoring and control approaches, including data collection, submission, handling, analysis, reconciliation and dissemination associated with catch certification schemes and options for addressing the costs; and viii) Any other relevant issues or information. 2. The Commission shall also hold a Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures meeting in 2014 to review the draft recommendation on catch certification in Appendix 3 of the Report of the 7 th IMM WG and consider the development of catch certification schemes in light of the results of the discussions on paragraph 1 above. 3. In considering matters mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2, CPCs shall take into account the progress of developments of the Electronic Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation (eBCD) programme and each CPC’s experience of existing catch documentation schemes. 4. The Commission at its 2014 Annual Meeting shall consider any draft recommendations on catch certification schemes for tuna species for their adoption with a view to implementing such scheme in 2015. 530 18-14 SDP RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT AMENDING FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND ONE RESOLUTION (Entry into force 21 June 2019) RECOGNISING that the ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation Program replaced the ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Program; NOTING that many previously adopted Recommendations and Resolutions make reference to the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document and to Statistical Document Programs in general; CONSIDERING that the coverage of bluefin tuna is intended in references to Statistical Document Programs in general; FURTHER NOTING that the measures adopted for the previous bluefin tuna statistical document program pertained to the bigeye tuna and swordfish statistical document programs; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. References to the ‘bluefin tuna statistical document program’ and ‘bluefin tuna statistical documents’ be replaced by ‘bluefin tuna catch document program’ and ‘bluefin tuna catch documents’ in the following provisions: i) Recommendation by ICCAT on Bluefin Tuna Farming (Rec. 06 -071): paragraphs 2b and 2f, paragraph 4, paragraph 8, paragraph 9f and the Caging Declaration contained in the Annex to the Recommendation; ii) Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning Trade Measures (Rec. 06-13), paragraph 2b. 2.

The first sentence of paragraph 2(3) of the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the ICCAT Bigeye Tuna Statistical Document Program (Rec. 01 -21) and the Recommendation by ICCAT Establishing a Swordfish Statistical Document Program (Rec. 01-22) be replaced, mutatis mutandis, by paragraphs A- D of the Resolution by ICCAT Concerning Validation by a Government Official of the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document (Res. 93-02). 4. Paragraph 14 of the Recommendation by ICCAT Concerning the ICCAT Bigeye Tuna Statistical Document Program (Rec. 01 -21) and paragraph 13 of the Recommendation by ICCAT Establishing a Swordfish Statistical Document Program (Rec. 01-22) be replaced mutatis mutandis by the Recommendation by ICCAT on Validation of the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document by the European Community (Rec. 98-12). 5. This measure repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT Amending Ten Recommendations and Three Resolutions (Rec. 08-11). 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 21-08, 22-08 and 24-05. 2 This measure was repealed and replaced by Rec. 19-09. 531 23-21 SDP RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT AMENDING AND REPLACING RECOMMENDATION 18-13 ON AN ICCAT BLUEFIN TUNA CATCH DOCUMENTATION PROGRAMME (Entry into force 18 June 2024) RECOGNIZING the situation of Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks and the impact that market factors have on the fishery; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the rebuilding plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna and the recovery plan for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna that ICCAT has adopted, including the need for complementary market related measures; RECOGNIZING the necessity to clarify and improve the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme, providing detailed instructions for the issuance, numbering, completion and the validation of the bluefin tuna catch document; NOTING that, in 2021, the Commission adopted an amendment to paragraph 13b) through the adoption of Rec. 18-13; CONSIDERING the absence of information in the electronic bluefin catch documentation (eBCD) systems relating to the processing of fish from farms and traps on board processing vessels; BEARING IN MIND the deliberations on the technical aspects by the Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures (IMM); THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: Part I General provisions 1. Each Contracting Party, Cooperating non -Contracting Party, Entity and Fishing Entity (hereafter referred to as CPCs) shall take the necessary steps to implement an ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation Scheme for the purpose of identifying the origin of any bluefin tuna in order to support the implementation of conservation and management measures. 2. For the purpose of this programme: a) "Domestic trade" means: – trade of bluefin tuna harvested in the ICCAT Convention area by a vessel or trap, which is landed in the territory of the CPC where the vessel is flagged or where the trap is established, and – trade of farmed bluefin tuna products originating from bluefin tuna harvested in the ICCAT Convention area by a vessel which is flagged to the same CPC where the farm is established, which is supplied to any entity in this CPC, and – trade between the Member States of the European Union of bluefin tuna harvested in the ICCAT Convention area by vessels flagged to one Member State or by a trap established in one Member State. b) "Export" means: Any movement of bluefin tuna in its harvested or processed form (including farmed) from the territory of the CPC where the fishing vessel is flagged or where the trap or farm is established to the territory of another CPC or non-Contracting Party, or from the fishing grounds to the territory of a CPC which is not the flag CPC of the fishing vessel or to the territory of a non -Contracting Party. 532 c) "Import" means: Any introduction of bluefin tuna in its harvested or processed form (including farmed) into the territory of a CPC, which is not the CPC where the fishing vessel is flagged or where the trap or the farm is established. d) "Re-export" means: Any movement of bluefin tuna in its harvested or processed form (including farmed) from the territory of a CPC where it has been previously imported. e) “Flag CPC” means the CPC where the fishing vessel is flagged; “trap CPC” means the CPC where the trap is established; and “farm CPC” means the CPC where the farm is established. 3. A Bluefin Tuna Catch Document (BCD) shall be completed for each bluefin tuna in accordance with Annex 3. Each consignment of bluefin tuna domestically traded, imported into or exported or re-exported from its territories shall be accompanied by a validated BCD, except in cases where paragraph 13(c) applies and, as applicable, an ICCAT transfer declaration or a validated Bluefin Tuna Re export Certificate (BFTRC). Any such landing, transfer, delivery, harvest, domestic trade, import, export or re -export of bluefin tuna without a completed and validated BCD or a BFTRC shall be prohibited. 4. In order to support an effective BCD, CPCs shall not place bluefin tuna into a farm not authorized by the CPC or listed in the ICCAT record. 5. Farm CPCs shall ensure that bluefin tuna catches are placed in separate cages or series of cages and partitioned on the basis of flag CPC origin. By derogation, if the bluefin tuna are caught in the context of a joint fishing operation (JFO) between different CPCs, farm CPCs shall ensure that bluefin tuna are placed in separate cages or series of cages and partitioned on the basis of JFOs. 6. At the time of caging, r elevant BCDs may be grouped as a “Grouped BCD” with a new BCD number in the following cases, provided that caging of all the fish is conducted on the same day and all the fish is caged in the same farming cage: a) Multiple catches made by the same vessel b) Catches made by JFO The Grouped BCD shall replace all the related original BCDs and be accompanied by the list of all the associated BCD numbers. The copies of such associated BCDs shall be made available upon request of CPCs. 7. Farm CPCs shall ensure that bluefin tuna are harvested from farms in the same year in which they were caught, or before the beginning of the purse seiners fishing period, if harvested in the following year. In the case where harvesting operations are not completed before this date, farm CPCs shall complete and transmit an annual carry-over declaration to the ICCAT Secretariat within 15 days after this date. Such declaration shall include: – Quantities (expressed in kg) and number of fish intended to be carried over, – Year of catch, – Average weight, – Flag CPC, – References of the BCD corresponding to the catches carried over, – Name and ICCAT number of the farm, – Cage number, and – Information on harvested quantities (expressed in kg), when completed. 533 8. Quantities carried over in accordance with paragraph 7 shall be placed in separate cages or series of cages in the farm on the basis of the catch year. 9. Each CPC shall provide BCD forms only to catching vessels and traps authorized to fish bluefin tuna in the Convention area, including as bycatch. Such forms are not transferable. Each BCD form shall have a unique document identification number. Document numbers shall be specific to the flag or trap CPC and assigned to the catching vessel or trap. 10. Domestic trade, export, import and re -export of fish parts other than the meat (i.e., heads, eyes, roes, guts and tails) shall be exempted from the requirements of this Recommendation. Part II Validation of BCDs 11. The catching vessel Master or trap operator, or its authorized representative, or the operator of farms, or the authorized representative of the flag, farm, or trap CPC, shall complete the BCD by providing the required information in appropriate sections and request validation in accordance with paragraph 13 for a BCD for catch landed, transferred to cages, harvested, transhipped, domestically traded or exported on each occasion that it lands, transfers, harvests, transships, domestically trades or exports bluefin tuna. 12. A validated BCD shall include, as appropriate, the information identified in Annex 1 attached. A BCD format is attached as Annex 2. In cases where a section of the BCD format does not provide enough room to completely track movement of BFT from catch to market, the needed information section of the BCD maybe expanded as necessary and attached as an annex using the original BCD format a nd number. The authorized representative of the CPC shall validate the annex as soon as possible but not later than the next movement of BFT. 13. a) The BCD must be validated by an authorized government official, or other authorized individual or institution, of the flag CPC of the catching vessel, the CPC of the seller/exporter, or the trap or farm CPC that caught, harvested, domestically traded or exported the bluefin tuna. b) The CPCs shall validate the BCD for all bluefin tuna products only when all the information contained in the BCD has been established to be accurate as a result of the verification of the consignment, and only when the accumulated validated amounts are within their quotas or catch limits of each management year, including, where appropriate, individual quotas allocated to catching vessels or traps, and when those products comply with other relevant ICCAT provisions of the conservation and management measures. The requirement that CPCs shall only validate BCDs when the accumulated validated amounts are within their quotas or catch limits of each management year, does not apply to CPCs with a domestic legislation introduced before 2013 requiring that all dead or dying fish be landed, provided that the value of the catch is subject to confiscation in order to prevent the fishermen from drawing any commercial profit from such fish. The CPCs shall take necessary measures to prevent catch, which is over its national quota from being exported to other CPCs. The weight of each consignment related to catches exceeding the vessel quotas shall be reported to the ICCAT Secretariat without delay and will be examined by the Compliance Committee during each annual meeting. c) Validation under 13(a) shall not be required in the event that all bluefin tuna available for sale are tagged by the flag CPC of the catching vessel or the trap CPC that fished the bluefin tuna. d) Where the bluefin tuna quantities caught and landed are less than one metric ton or three fish, the logbook or the sales note may be used as a temporary BCD, pending the validation of the BCD within seven days and prior to export. 534 Part III Validation of BFTRCs 14. Each CPC shall ensure that each bluefin tuna consignment which is re -exported from its territory be accompanied by a validated BFTRC. In cases where bluefin tuna is imported live, the BFTRC shall not apply. 15. The operator who is responsible for the re-export shall complete the BFTRC by providing the required information in its appropriate sections and request its validation for the bluefin tuna consignment to be re-exported. The completed BFTRC shall be accompanied by a copy of the validated BCD(s) relating to the bluefin tuna products previously imported. 16. The BFTRC shall be validated by an authorized government official or authority. 17. The CPC shall validate the BFTRC for all bluefin tuna product only when: a) all the information contained in the BFTRC has been established to be accurate, b) the validated BCD(s) submitted in support to the BFTRC had been accepted for the importation of the products declared on the BFTRC, c) the products to be re -exported are wholly or partly the same product on the validated BCD(s), and d) a copy of the BCD(s) shall be attached to the validated BFTRC. 18. The validated BFTRC shall include the information identified in Annex 4 and Annex 5 attached. Part IV Verification and communication 19. Each CPC shall communicate a copy of all validated BCDs or BFTRCs, except in cases where paragraph 13(c) applies, within five working days following the date of validation, or without delay where the expected duration of the transportation should not take more than five working days, to the following: a) the competent authorities of the country where the bluefin tuna will be domestically traded, or transferred into a cage or imported, and b) the ICCAT Secretariat. 20. The ICCAT Secretariat shall extract from the validated BCDs or BFTRCs communicated under paragraph 19 above the information marked with an asterisk (*) in Annex 1 or Annex 4 and enter this information in a database on a password protected section of its website, as soon as practicable. At its request, the SCRS shall have access to the catch information contained in the database, except the vessel or trap names. Part V Tagging 21. CPCs may require their catching vessels or traps to affix a tag to each bluefin tuna preferably at the time of kill, but no later than the time of landing. Tags shall have unique country specific numbers and be tamper proof. The tag numbers shall be linked to the BCD and a summary of the implementation of the tagging programme shall be submitted to the ICCAT Secretariat by the CPC. The use of such tags shall only be authorized when the accumulated catch amounts are within their quotas or catch limits of each management year, including, where appropriate, individual quotas allocated to vessels or traps. 535 Part VI Verification 22. Each CPC shall ensure that its competent authorities, or other authorized individual or institution, take steps to identify each consignment of bluefin tuna landed in, domestically traded in, imported into or exported or re-exported from its territory and request and examine the validated BCD(s) and related documentation of each consignment of bluefin tuna. These competent authorities, or authorized individuals or institutions, may also examine the content of the consignment to verify the information contained in the BCD and in related documents and, where necessary, shall carry out verifications with the operators concerned. 23. If, as a result of examinations or verifications carried out pursuant to paragraph 22 above, a doubt arises regarding the information contained in a BCD, the final importing State/CPC and the CPC whose competent authorities validated the BCD(s) or BFTRCs shall cooperate to resolve such doubts. 24. If a CPC involved in trade of bluefin tuna identifies a consignment with no BCD, it shall notify the findings to the exporting CPC and, where known, the flag CPC. 25. Pending the examinations or verifications under paragraph 22 to confirm compliance of the bluefin tuna consignment with the requirements in the present Recommendation and any other relevant Recommendations, the CPCs shall not grant its release for domestic trade, import or export, nor, in the case of live bluefin tuna destined to farms, accept the transfer declaration. 26. Where a CPC, as a result of examination or verifications under paragraph 22 above and in cooperation with the validating authorities concerned, determines that a BCD or BFTRC is invalid, the domestic trade, import, export or re-export of the bluefin tuna concerned shall be prohibited. 27. The Commission shall request the non-Contracting Parties that are involved in domestic trade, import, export or re -export of bluefin tuna to cooperate with the implementation of the programme and to provide to the Commission data obtained from such implementation. Part VII Notification and communication 28. Each CPC that validates BCDs in respect of its flag catching vessels, traps or farms in accordance with paragraph 13(a), shall notify the ICCAT Secretariat of the government authorities, or other authorized individuals or institutions (name and full address of the organization(s) and, where appropriate, name and title of the validating officials who are individually empowered, sample form of document, sample impression of stamp or seal, and as appropriate tag samples) responsible for validating and verifyin g BCDs or BFTRCs. This notification shall indicate the date at which this entitlement comes into force. A copy of the provisions adopted in national law for the purpose of implementing the bluefin tuna catch documentation programme shall be communicated wi th the initial notification, including procedures to authorize nongovernmental individuals or institutions. Updated details on validating authorities and national provisions shall be communicated to the ICCAT Secretariat in a timely fashion. 29. The information on validating authorities transmitted by notifications to the ICCAT Secretariat shall be placed on the password protected page of the database on validation held by the ICCAT Secretariat. The list of the CPCs having notified their validating authorities and the notified dates of entry into force of the validation shall be placed on a publicly accessible website held by the ICCAT Secretariat. CPCs are encouraged to access this information to help verify the validation of BCDs and BFTRCs. 30. Each CPC shall notify to the ICCAT Secretariat the points of contact (name and full address of the organization(s)) that should be notified when there are questions related to BCDs or BFTRCs. 31. Copies of validated BCDs and notification pursuant to paragraphs 28, 29 and 30 shall be sent by CPCs to the ICCAT Secretariat, by electronic means, whenever possible. 32. Copies of BCDs shall follow each part of split shipments or processed product, using the unique document number of the BCD to link them. 536 33. CPCs shall keep copies of documents issued or received for at least two years. 34. CPCs shall provide to the ICCAT Secretariat a report each year by 15 September for the period from 1 January to 31 December of the preceding year to provide the information described in Annex 6. The ICCAT Secretariat shall post these reports on the password protected section of the ICCAT website, as soon as practicable. At its request, the SCRS shall have access to the reports received by the ICCAT Secretariat. 35.

THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. All CPCs concerned shall, as soon as possible for eBCD system implementation, submit to the Secretariat the data necessary to ensure the registration of their users in the eBCD system. Access to and use of the system cannot be ensured for those who fail to provide and maintain the data required by the eBCD system. 2. Use of the eBCD system is mandatory for all CPCs and paper BCDs shall no longer be accepted, except in the limited circumstances specified in paragraph 6 below. 3. CPCs may communicate to the Secretariat and the Standing Catch Document Scheme Working Group (CDS WG) their experiences on technical aspects of system implementation including any difficulties experienced and identification of improvements to functionalities to enhance eBCD implementation and performance. The Commission may consider these recommendations and financial support to further develop the system. 552 4. The substantive provisions of Recommendation by ICCAT amending and replacing Recommendation 18-13 on an ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation programme (Rec. 23-21) shall be applied mutatis mutandis to the electronic BCDs (eBCDs). 5. Notwithstanding paragraph 4 of this Recommendation, the following provisions shall be applied with respect to the BCD programme and its implementation through the eBCD system: a) Following the recording and validation of catch and first trade in the eBCD system in accordance with Part II of Recommendation 23-21, the recording of information on internal sales of bluefin tuna in the eBCD (i.e. sales occurring within one Contracting Party or Cooperating non-Contracting Party, Entity or Fishing Entity (CPC) or, in the case of the European Union, within one of its Member States) is not required. b) Following the recording and validation of catch and first trade in the eBCD, the domestic trade between Member States of the European Union shall be completed in the eBCD system by the seller consistent with paragraph 13 of Recommendation 23 -21; however, i n derogation to Recommendation 23-21, where such trade is of bluefin tuna that is in the following product forms listed on the eBCD, validation shall not be required: “fillets” (FL) or “other, specified” (OT). “Gilled and gutted” (GG), “dressed” (DR), and “round” (RD) product forms shall require validation. When such product (FL and OT) is packaged for transport, however, the associated eBCD number must be written legibly and indelibly on the outside of any package containing any part of the tuna except for exempted products specified in paragraph 10 of Recommendation 23-21. For such product (FL and OT), in addition to the requirements in the above paragraph, subsequent domestic trade to another Member State shall only take place when the trade information from the previous Member State has been recorded in the eBCD system. Export from the European Union shall take place only if the previous trade between Member States has been properly recorded, and such export shall continue to require validation in the eBCD system consistent with paragraph 13 of Rec. 23-21. The derogation in this paragraph shall be applicable from 1 January 2025. The European Union shall report to the Commission on the implementation of this derogation by 1 October each year of the derogation , and while the statistics contained in this report cannot be generated by the eBCD system, and made automatically available to all the ICCAT Commission and CPCs for their consultation. This report shall include information on its process for verification and the outcomes of that process and data about these trade events, including relevant statistical information. The trade of live bluefin tuna including all trade events to and from bluefin farms must be recorded and validated in the eBCD system in accordance with the provisions of Recommendation 23-21 unless otherwise specified in this Recommendation. The validation of sections 2 (catch) and 3 (live trade) in the eBCD may be completed simultaneously in derogation to paragraph 3 of Recommendation 23-21. The amending and re-validation of sections 2 and 3 in the eBCD as required by paragraph 99 of the Recommendation by ICCAT Establishing a Multi- Annual Management Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea (Rec. 18-02)1 may be completed following caging operation. c) Bluefin tuna harvested in sport and recreational fisheries for which sale is prohibited is not subject to the terms of Recommendation 23-21 and need not be recorded in the eBCD system. d) The provisions of paragraph 13 of Recommendation 23-21 for waiving government validation of tagged fish only apply when the domestic commercial tagging programmes of the flag CPC for the vessel or trap that harvested the bluefin tuna under which the fish are tagged are consistent with the requirements of paragraph 21 of that Recommendation and meet the following criteria: i. All bluefin tuna in the eBCD concerned are individually tagged; ii. Minimum information associated with the tag includes: 1 This measure was repealed and successively replaced by Recommendations 19-04, 21-08, 22-08 and 24-05. 553 - Identifying information on the catching vessel or trap; - Date of capture or landing; - The area of harvest of the fish in the shipment; - The gear utilized to catch the fish; - The type of product and individual weight of the tagged bluefin tuna, which may be done through the appending of an annex. Alternatively for those fisheries concerned by the derogations to minimum size under the Rec. 18 -02, CPCs may instead provide the approximate weight of indiv idual fish within the catch upon offloading, which is determined through averaging the total landing weight over the number of individual fish; - Information on the exporter and importer (where applicable); - The point of export (where applicable). iii. Information on tagged fish is compiled by the responsible CPC. e) Bluefin tuna that die during the transfer, towing, or caging operations foreseen by paragraphs 86 to 102 of Rec . 18-02 prior to harvesting may be traded by the purse seine vessel, auxiliary/support vessel(s), and/or farm representatives, where applicable. f) Bluefin tuna that are caught as bycatch in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean by vessels not authorized to fish actively for bluefin tuna pursuant to Rec. 18 -02 may be traded. In order to improve the functioning of the eBCD system access to the system by CPC authorities, port authorities and/or through authorised self-registration shall be facilitated, including by way of their national registration number. Such registration only permits access to the eBCD system and does not represent an authorisation by ICCAT; hence no ICCAT number shall be issued. Flag CPCs of the vessels concerned are not required to submit a list of such vessels to the ICCAT Secretariat. g) The requirement in paragraph 13 b) of Recommendation 23-21 providing that BCDs may only be issued when the accumulated validated amounts are within their quotas or catch limits of each management year, does not apply to CPCs whose domestic legislation requires that all dead or dying fish be landed, provided that the value of the catch is subj ect to confiscation in order to prevent the fishermen from drawing any commercial profit from such fish. The CPC shall take necessary measures to prevent the confiscated fish from being exported to other CPCs. h) Paper BCDs shall continue to be used for the trade of Pacific bluefin tuna until such time as the functionality for such tracking is developed within the eBCD system. Such functionality shall include the data elements listed in Annexes 1 and 2 unless otherwise decided to address future data collection needs. i) The trade section of an eBCD shall be validated prior to export. The buyer information in the trade section must be entered into the eBCD system as soon as available and prior to re-export. j) Access to the eBCD system shall be granted to ICCAT non-CPCs to facilitate trade of bluefin tuna. Until such time as the functionality is developed that allows non -CPC access to the system, this shall be accomplished through completion by the non-CPC of paper BCD programme documents consistent with the terms of paragraph 6 and submission to the ICCAT Secretariat for entry into the eBCD system. The Secretariat shall communicate without delay to those non-CPCs known to trade in Atlantic bluefin tuna to make them aware of the eBCD system and the provisions of the BCD programme applicable to them. k) To the extent possible, reports generated from the eBCD system shall fulfill the annual reporting requirements in paragraph 34 of Recommendation 23 -21. CPCs shall also continue to provide those elements of the annual report that cannot be produced from the eBCD system. The format and content of any additional reports shall be determined by the Commission taking into account appropriate confidentiality rules and considerations. At a minimum, reports shall include catch and trade data by the CPCs that are appropriately aggregated. CPCs shall continue to repor t on their implementation of the eBCD system in their Annual Reports. 554 6. Paper BCD documents (issued pursuant to Recommendation 23-21) or printed eBCDs may be used in the following cases: a) Landings of quantities of bluefin tuna less than one metric ton or three fish. Such paper BCDs shall be converted to eBCDs within a period of seven working days or prior to export, whichever is first. b) Bluefin tuna caught prior to the full implementation of the eBCD system as specified in paragraph 2. c) Notwithstanding the requirement to use the eBCD system in paragraph 2, paper BCDs or printed eBCDs may be used as a back -up in the limited event that technical difficulties with the system arise that preclude a CPC from using the eBCD system, following the procedures as set forth in Annex 3. Delays by CPCs in taking necessary actions, such as providing the data necessary to ensure the registration of users in the eBCD system or other avoidable situations, do not constitute an acceptable technical difficulty. d) In the case of trade of Pacific bluefin tuna as specified in paragraph 5 h). e) In the case of trade between ICCAT CPCs and non-CPCs where access to the eBCD system through the Secretariat (pursuant to paragraph 5 j) above) is not possible or is not timely enough to ensure the trade is not unduly delayed or disrupted. The use of a paper BCD document in the cases specified in sub-paragraphs a) through e) shall not be cited by importing CPCs as a reason to delay or deny import of a bluefin tuna shipment provided it complies with the existing provisions of Recommendation 23-21 and relevant provisions of this Recommendation. Printed eBCDs that are validated in the eBCD system satisfy the validation requirement stipulated in paragraph 3 of Recommendation 23-21. Where requested by a CPC, conversion of paper BCDs to eBCDs shall be facilitated by the ICCAT Secretariat or through the creation in the eBCD system of user profiles for CPC authorities at their request for this purpose, as appropriate. 7. The CDS WG shall continue its work and, through the ICCAT Secretariat, inform the developing consortium of the specifications on required system developments and adjustments and steer their implementation. 8. This Recommendation clarifies Rec. 18-02 and clarifies and amends Rec. 23-21. 9. This Recommendation repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT amending Recommendation 21-18 on the application of the eBCD system (Rec. 22-16). 555 Annex 1 Data requirement for the trade of Pacific bluefin tuna under the BCD program Section 1: Bluefin Tuna Catch Document Number Section 2: Catch information Name of catching vessel/trap Flag/CPC Area Total weight (kg) Section 8: Trade information Product description • (F/FR; RD/GG/DR/FL/OT) • Total weight (NET) Exporter/seller information • Company name • Point of export/departure • State of destination Transportation description Government validation Importer/buyer • Company name, license number • Point of import or destination Annex 2 ICCAT Bluefin Tuna Re-Export Certificate Section 1: Bluefin Tuna Re-Export Certificate Number Section 2: Re-export section Re-export country/entity/fishing entity Point of re-export Section 3: Description of imported bluefin tuna Net weight (kg) BCD (or eBCD) number and date(s) of importation Section 4: Description of bluefin tuna for re-export Net weight (kg) Corresponding BCD (or eBCD) number State of destination Section 6: Government validation 556 Annex 3 Procedures to allow the issuance of paper BCDs or printed eBCDs due to technical difficulties with the eBCD system A. If the technical difficulty occurs during working hours of the Secretariat and the eBCD implementing consortium: 1. As an initial step, the CPC encountering the technical difficulty shall contact the implementing consortium to confirm and try to resolve the technical difficulty and also include the Secretariat in these communications. The implementing consortium shall p rovide an acknowledgement of the technical difficulty to the CPC. 2. In the case where a technical difficulty that has been confirmed by the implementing consortium cannot be resolved before a trade event must occur, the CPC shall inform the Secretariat of the nature of the technical difficulty and provide it with the infor mation set out in the attached Appendix as well as a copy of the confirmation of the technical difficulty from the implementing consortium. 3. The Secretariat shall notify other CPCs that paper BCDs may temporarily be used by the CPC encountering the technical difficulty by posting the information provided in paragraph 2 above on the public part of the ICCAT website without delay. The CPC may the n use a paper BCD or a printed eBCD for the trade event. 4. A CPC encountering the technical difficulty shall continue to work with the implementing consortium and, as appropriate, the Secretariat to resolve the issue. 5. The CPC shall report when the technical difficulty has been resolved, either through the eBCD system self -reporting incident site or to the Secretariat, for immediate posting on the ICCAT website. The CPC shall then follow the procedures in Section C, below. B. If the technical difficulty occurs outside working hours of the Secretariat and the eBCD implementing consortium: 1. The CPC encountering the technical difficulty shall immediately communicate to the Secretariat and the implementing consortium via email that it is unable to use the eBCD system with an explanation of the technical difficulty encountered. To proceed with a trade, the CPC must then access the self-reporting incident site to enter the required information specified in the attached Appendix. Through the site, this information shall be automatically uploaded to the ICCAT website to notify other CPCs that paper BCDs or printed eBCDs may temporarily be used by the CPC encountering the technical difficulty. The CPC may then use a paper BCD or a printed eBCD for the trade event. 2. If the technical difficulty is not resolved before the start of the next business day of the Secretariat and the implementing consortium, the CPC encountering the technical difficulty shall contact the implementing consortium and, as needed, the Secretaria t, as soon as possible during that next business day in order to resolve the technical difficulty. 3. The CPC shall report when the technical difficulty has been resolved, either through the self - reporting incident site or the Secretariat, for immediate posting on the ICCAT website. The CPC shall then follow the procedures in Section C, below. 557 C. In all cases where a paper BCD or printed eBCD has been used in accordance with the procedures specified in sections A or B above, the following also applies: 1. The CPC shall resume use of the eBCD system as soon as the technical difficulty is resolved. 2. Paper BCDs shall be converted into an eBCD by the CPC that used the paper BCD or by the ICCAT Secretariat if the CPC requests it to do so, as soon as possible following resolution of the technical difficulty. In case that conversion cannot be fully completed by the CPC that used the paper BCD, it shall contact those CPCs which received the paper BCD and request its cooperation to complete the conversion for the e-BCD sections directly under the responsibility of the CPC which received a paper BCD. Such CPC that carried out or requested the conversion of the paper BCD shall be responsible for reporting to the Secretariat that the technical difficulty has been resolved, and, where appropriate, uploading relevant information to the self-reporting incident site. As soon as possible after resolution of the technical difficulty, a CPC that has received a paper BCD shall take appropriate actions to ensure that the paper BCD is not used for subsequent trade events. 3. Where a printed eBCD has been used, CPCs shall ensure that any missing data from the eBCD record is uploaded into the eBCD system as soon as the technical difficulty is resolved for the sections under their direct responsibility. 4. Paper BCDs or printed eBCDs may continue to be used until such time as the technical difficulty is resolved and the paper BCDs concerned are converted into eBCDs in accordance with the procedure above. 5. Once a paper BCD has been converted to an eBCD, all subsequent trade events of product associated with that paper BCD shall be carried out only in the eBCD system. D. In the case of technical difficulties experienced by importing CPCs, the importing CPC may request the exporting CPC concerned to issue a paper BCD or printed eBCD to support trade after notice of the technical difficulty has been posted on the ICCAT website in accordance with the procedures specified in sections A or B above. The exporting CPC shall verify that the notification of the technical difficulty is posted on the ICCAT website before issuing the paper BCD or printed eBCD. Importing CPCs shall report when the technical difficulty has been resolved, either through the self -reporting incident site or the Secretariat, for immediate posting on the ICCAT website. E. Throughout the year, the Secretariat shall compile information on cases where a CPC reported a technical difficulty and/or paper documents were issued, for review by the PWG at the subsequent ICCAT Annual Meeting. If the PWG determines that the reporting procedures set forth above were not followed or that the use of paper was not otherwise consistent with the provisions of this Recommendation, the PWG shall consider appropriate actions, including possible referral to the Compliance Committee, if appropriate. F. The procedures set forth above shall be reviewed in 2019 and revised, as appropriate.

Evaluate and, if possible, prioritize applications for port inspection capacity building assistance submitted to the Secretariat in accordance with paragraph 7 of Recommendation 14 -08. To facilitate this work, the Expert Group will: a) Develop one or more forms (with instructions) to help developing CPCs self -assess their port inspection capacity building needs and apply for assistance from ICCAT to address any identified needs, as appropriate. The Secretariat shall circulate the form(s) and instructions to all CPCs as soon as available and shall also post the form(s) and instructions on the public portion of the ICCAT website. 565 b) Review any other relevant information that might indicate a need for port inspection capacity building assistance, as compiled by the Secretariat and/or available from other sources. c) As appropriate, engage with developing CPCs regarding their port inspection capacity building needs, including exploring possible approaches for addressing those needs. d) Consider information on trainings or other capacity building assistance received by a developing CPC that was or will be provided outside of ICCAT’s capacity building efforts. As required by the Expert Group, the Secretariat shall compile relevant information to support this task. 4. Identify CPCs with existing capacity building programmes that may be able to provide assistance to developing CPCs, and coordinate with the Secretariat to facilitate information exchange among these CPCs. Further, evaluate the potential to collaborate wit h the FAO in providing port inspection capacity building assistance in ICCAT through the FAO regional workshops related to implementation of the Port State Measures Agreement. In addition, consider if opportunities exist to cooperate with other governments or organizations on port inspection capacity building efforts. 5. Based on the work carried out under paragraphs 3 and 4 above, advise the Commission on the level and type of assistance that is needed, highlighting whether or not ICCAT funding would be required, to facilitate Commission decisions on the allocation of resources into and expenditures from the MCS Fund established in Recommendation 14-08. 6. Consider the effectiveness of the process and procedures for providing technical and capacity building assistance to developing CPCs with respect to the implementation of Recommendation 12-07 and, where relevant, advise the Permanent Working Group for the Improvement of Statistics and Conservation (PWG) on ways to improve that effectiveness, including through the identification of difficulties that may be unrelated to a lack of capacity, such as unclear port inspection scheme requirements. 7. The Expert Group will meet in 2017 to begin its work, preferably in conjunction with a meeting of the Integrated Monitoring Measures Working Group or other appropriate intersessional ICCAT meeting. In addition, the Expert Group should seek to advance issues electronically to the extent possible. 8. At its first meeting, the Expert Group will elect a Chair from among its members. All CPCs with an interest in port inspection capacity building are encouraged to provide an expert to participate in the Group. The Expert Group will consist of no more than one participant from each CPC, participating as experts in port inspection and/or developing CPC needs, and not representing the interests of their respective CPCs. The ICCAT Secretariat will provide support and assistance as needed to ensure that the E xpert Group can carry out these terms of reference as efficiently and effectively as possible. 566 16-19 TOR RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ONLINE REPORTING SYSTEM (Entry into force 12 June 2017) RECOGNIZING that ICCAT has adopted a significant number of measures that require CPCs to submit information in various formats and under different schedules; RECOGNIZING that the work of ICCAT benefits from timely and transparent information sharing; RECOGNIZING the developments in electronic information exchange and the benefits, to the Secretariat and ICCAT members, of rapid communication with regard to the processing, management, and distribution of information; NOTING the implementation of electronic systems will facilitate reporting, which should help address reporting delays, reporting in the wrong format, and incomplete reporting experienced by ICCAT under its current reporting process; DESIRING to find effective ways to reduce the workload on the Secretariat and enhance the effective functioning of ICCAT, including the Compliance Committee; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. An online reporting system shall be developed and maintained at the ICCAT Secretariat covering ICCAT reporting requirements, with an initial focus on elements of the required CPC Annual Reports. 2. An Online Reporting Technology Working Group is established, in collaboration with the ICCAT Secretariat, to develop the plan for the online reporting system, based on the elements presented in Annex 1. The Working Group should specify what information the system will collect, the format and structure of the user interface, and the underlying technical specifications. In developing these elements, the Working Group should include a cost -benefit analysi s of options for the development and maintenance of this system, with a priority on creating a simple, user-friendly system. 3. In carrying out the work specified in paragraph 2 above, the Working Group will determine which electronic reporting elements need to be undertaken by outsourced technical services and which can be developed by the Secretariat, based on experience and management of other existing systems, including open source solutions based on international UN/CEFACT standards, and taking into account information from other regional fisheries management organizations considering implementation of such systems. 4. This Working Group shall begin its work in 2017 with a completion goal of 2019. The Working Group will provide annual interim reports to the Commission on the progress of its work, including presenting its proposal for the content and format of the online reporting system to the Commission for its consideration in order to inform the development of the technical specifications referred to in paragraph 2. 5. Any interested CPCs are invited to participate and shall notify the Secretariat of the name of their Working Group participant by 15 January 2017. Participants identified should have knowledge and experience in the development and use of electronic, web -based reporting tools. The Working Group will select a chair from among its membership. 6. Once the online reporting system is established, training programs shall be developed and implemented to the extent possible through existing bilateral or broader capacity building and technical assistance programs, to ensure that CPCs utilize the system for a more efficient and effective reporting. 567 Annex 1 Concept note on an ICCAT online reporting system Purpose and Need ICCAT has adopted a significant number of measures that require CPCs to submit data and reports in various formats and under different schedules. This information is typically submitted via electronic mail to the general intake address (info@iccat.int). Th is approach places a significant burden on the Secretariat to evaluate the received information and place it into the appropriate databases for scientific and/or administrative uses. Additionally, there is a heavy burden on the Secretariat to extract the information from numerous electronic files in order to produce required reports and communications in a timely manner, in particular reports to support the work of the Compliance Committee. An online reporting system on the ICCAT website could provide CPCs with a unified and comprehensive approach to submitting information. The system could assist CPCs by providing a “single window” reporting and management tool for tracking and organizing their respective submissions. The online reporting system could replace the need to separately submit Annual Reports and, to the extent possible, many other periodic submissions to the Secretariat. Such a system could address the persistent problem of lack of reporting and/or incomplete and late reporting that creates work for the Secretariat and that impedes the effective functioning of the Compliance Committee. Extracts of information made directly by CPCs from the online reporting system could replace several reports and documents now prepared by the Secretariat and help streamline the support to the Compliance Committee and other ICCAT Sub -committees. In addition, these extracts could be available to CPCs at any time and could facilitate advance and more effective preparation for the Compliance Committee or other ICCAT bodies. Potential Features of a System The system would be based on a relational database consisting of individual reporting elements. These data elements are, to a large extent, already well defined (see ICCAT Guidelines for submitting data and the list of reporting requirements). The system would include integrated information on reporting elements indicating origin (ICCAT measure) and purpose, an explanation of the requirement, conditions of its applicability, and an indication of the format and due date. Filtering criteria would be assigned to each reporting element to enable system queries of a particular focus. For example, filters could be developed to allow selection by: - Associated Recommendation(s)/Resolution(s) - Associated Species (BFT, SWO, ALB, etc.) - Associated Subject (e.g., observers, vessels, MCS) - Reporting period (year) and applicable due date - Indication of whether the element contains legacy data or is an active requirement Mode of Operation The internet-based self-reporting would be accomplished by authorized CPC officials such as scientific and administrative correspondents. Password protected accounts would be assigned by the Secretariat and the system would have a self-service password reset. An automated e -mail reminder could be sent to designated CPC officials when a reporting element is due/overdue. The system would automatically record the CPC account that is used to enter/modify data and record dates of the original entry and most recent change for that reporting element on each annual cycle. 568 The CPC official would attach formatted files for loading into respective databases by Secretariat (e.g., Task 1 and Task 2 data, vessel lists). The Secretariat would record a CPC specific response in cases of incorrect/incomplete submission (system would record date of message). The Secretariat could post messages for response by involved CPCs (e.g., VMS irregularities, observer PNC reports, inspection reports, submissions under Rec. 08 -09) with automated e -mail notification of Secretariat queries to the individual CPCs. The Secretariat would develop and post an online user manual and help request tool. The Secretariat staff would have administrator role to assist/modify records when needed. An extract tool would allow CPCs to generate reports (at any time) according to selected filtering criteria (due date, associated species, subject, CPCs indicating not applicable, etc.). The system would be automatically locked from further changes to that year’s reporting requirement during the annual meeting/after the annual meeting/at the end of the calendar year. Benefits An online reporting system would reduce workload and streamline the process for the Secretariat’s compilation of information (direct submissions through online reporting system rather than collate information submitted in emails). The system would enforce formats and completeness of response (e.g., reporting that a measure is not applicable requires explanation). Access to structured, specific extracts would facilitate work of the Compliance Committee in assessing status of each CPC prior to meeting; the system would provide a harmonized real time and historical record of reporting status by measure, by subject area, etc. Such online systems promote transparency through access to extracts (similar to queries on conservation measures and authorized vessel list). Costs to Consider - Database development and user interface, including new reporting elements when new measures adopted and deactivation of legacy reporting elements when measures replaced/rescinded - Online user guide and training tools - Operations and maintenance costs 569 16-20 TOR RESOLUTION BY ICCAT TO ESTABLISH AN AD HOC WORKING GROUP TO FOLLOW UP ON THE SECOND ICCAT PERFORMANCE REVIEW (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 12 December 2016) CONSIDERING that the second performance review of ICCAT was carried out in 2016 by an external panel of experts; NOTING that the panel of experts highlighted a number of areas where ICCAT made progress since the first performance review; FURTHER NOTING that the panel of experts also drew up a number of recommendations to improve the performance of ICCAT; RECOGNIZING the necessity to follow up on the conclusions of the second performance review with a view to further strengthening ICCAT; RECALLING that a process to strengthen ICCAT was initiated in 2005 and that in 2006 ICCAT established a Working Group on the future of ICCAT that was tasked, among other things, to follow -up on the recommendations of the first performance review; RECOGNIZING that it would be appropriate to establish an ad -hoc Working Group to propose recommendations to the Commission for next steps further to the second performance review; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES AS FOLLOWS: 1. An ad -hoc Working Group on Performance Review Follow -up is established and will meet intersessionally in 2017 to: a) examine the outcomes of the second independent performance review of ICCAT to identify issues raised and recommendations made by the Performance Review Panel that need further consideration; and b) propose next steps in light of the examination carried out pursuant to 1(a) in particular draw up a work plan specifying which ICCAT body (Commission, Committee, Working Group or Panel) should consider identified issues and recommendations. 2. The ad-hoc Working Group will report to the Commission at its 2017 Annual meeting on the outcomes of its deliberations. 3. At its 2017 Annual Meeting the Commission will consider the outcomes of ad-hoc Working Group and decide on a work plan. 4. The Working Group will be supported by the ICCAT Secretariat and will be chaired by the ICCAT Chairman. 570 16-21 TOR RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ON THE THIRD MEETING OF THE STANDING WORKING GROUP FOR ENHANCING THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN FISHERIES SCIENTISTS AND MANAGERS (SWGSM) (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 12 December 2016) RECOGNIZING that ICCAT has adopted Recommendation 15 -07 for the development of Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) and Harvest Control Rules (HCR); ACKNOWLEDGING that in 2016 the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) responded to the Commission’s request to provide a 5-year schedule for advancing this work; CONSIDERING the need for continuing dialogue between scientists and managers; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: Based on ICCAT Recommendation 14 -13, for Enhancing the Dialogue between Fisheries scientists and Managers, a meeting of the Standing Working Group for Enhancing the Dialogue Between Fisheries Scientists and Managers (SWGSM) will be held in 2017 and thereafter as appropriate. Appendix 1 Draft Agenda for 2017 1. SWGSM Terms of Reference (Rec. 14-13) and outcomes of 1st and 2nd SWGSM meetings 2.

In the next management cycle after B has been determined to be less than Blim the TAC is fixed during three years to the level corresponding to F lim, and the catch will stay at such minimum level for three years. The biomass, however, may react quickly to the lowering of F and increase rapidly so that one or more of the three years of the cycle will have B>B lim. 4 Useful in the absence of TAC-related constraints in the harvest control rule. 5 Positive and negative changes to be reported separately. 6 Positive and negative changes to be reported separately. 573 16-22 TOR RESOLUTION BY ICCAT TO FACILITATE AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT COMPLIANCE PROCESS (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 12 December 2016) RECOGNIZING the substantial amount of information that must be reviewed and analyzed to prepare for meetings of the Compliance Committee; DESIRING to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of ICCAT’s compliance review process in a fair, equitable, and transparent manner; and NOTING that the effort to enhance ICCAT’s compliance review process will, necessarily, be iterative in nature and that future review and amendment of the process set forth in this Resolution will be informed by the COC’s experience in its implementation; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. The Secretariat will, in consultation with the Compliance Committee (COC) Chair, compile an inventory of compliance information for each CPC (i.e., Draft Summary Compliance Tables), using all appropriate sources, including reports submitted under Recommend ation 08 -09. The Draft Summary Compliance Tables will include information on whether CPCs complied with applicable recommendations of the Commission, including reporting obligations. Further, if requested by the COC or COC Chair, the Secretariat will also compile a supplementary inventory of compliance information by species, issue, or topic (i.e., supplementary tables) to facilitate focused compliance review of identified priority matters. 2. The Secretariat will circulate the Draft Summary Compliance Tables and any supplementary tables to all CPCs for their review as far in advance of the ICCAT Annual meeting as possible with a target deadline of three weeks before the opening session. CPCs wi ll be invited to give initial, written explanations of inaccuracies or additional information to the Secretariat on their own compliance information as reflected in the Draft Summary Compliance Tables and any supplementary tables at least five days before the start of the first session of the COC. The COC will hold its first session early in the ICCAT Annual Meeting as determined by the Commission Chair or at an appropriate time before the start of the ICCAT Annual Meeting if so decided by the Commission. 3. Prior to the first COC session, the COC Chair will review any written input received from CPCs on the Draft Summary Compliance Tables and any supplementary tables, revise the tables as appropriate, and recirculate them to the CPCs. At this time, the COC C hair will also identify and propose priority CPCs or cases, as well as broader issues or areas of focus for the current or a future ICCAT Annual Meeting, as needed and appropriate. 4. To assist with the tasks specified in paragraph 3 above, the COC Chair may convene a Friends of the Chair Review Group before and/or during the ICCAT Annual Meeting. If and when such a Group is to be convened, all CPCs will be notified and invited to provide one representative to participate in its work and interested CPCs should ensure their representative has expertise in Commission recommendations. To ensure the work of the group is as efficient and effective as possible, the Chair will ensure that the composition of the Group is as small as feasible given the varied fisheries interests of CPCs and reflects the geographical representation of the Commission to the extent possible. Participants will take no active part in discussions of compliance issues pertaining to their CPC during meetings of the Friends of the Chair Review Group. A CPC’s ability to engage in compliance related discussions during COC sessions, however, will not be affected by participation on the Friends of the Chair Review Group. The COC Chair may also invite the Panel, PWG, and SCRS Chairs to participate in the Group, as appropriate. 574 5. The first COC session should be held early in the annual meeting. Discussions will focus on those priority cases, CPCs, or issues identified pursuant to paragraph 3. Other CPCs, cases, and issues not identified as priorities, will not be discussed, unless a CPC raises a specific matter for discussion. Each CPC will have the opportunity to provide additional information concerning their compliance during this discussion, such as any mitigating circumstances or actions they intend to take to ensure future compliance and, as needed, to allow for questions and discussions. 6. Additionally, once every two years, the COC will hold a special session just prior to the ICCAT Annual Meeting for a CPC by CPC review. 7. After the initial discussion review, the COC Chair will consider any additional information provided under paragraph 5 above or available from other sources, revise and finalize the Summary Compliance Tables and any supplementary tables with assistance fro m the Secretariat, and, where appropriate, propose actions for addressing issues of non-compliance, taking into account any guidance that may be adopted by the Commission. The COC Chair may seek assistance from the Friends of the Chair Group in completing this task. The Chair will ensure that the Group's deliberations and the Chair's rationale underpinning each proposed action to address issues of non-compliance are clearly documented. 8. After completion of the work specified in paragraph 6, the Chair will have the draft Summary Compliance Tables, any supplementary tables, and the Chair’s proposed compliance status and actions to address non- compliance (with documented rationale) circulate d to the CPCs for consideration by the COC at a later session held during the ICCAT Annual Meeting. Provided this transparent, well -documented compliance review process has been followed, neither repeated discussion of compliance issues, nor a detailed presentation of each proposed action, should be necessary. Rather, at this stage of the process, substantive COC discussion should be reserved for those cases where there are differences of view on the Chair’s proposed action. Once any such differences have been resolved, the COC will forward its recommendations for addressing any issues of non-compliance to the Commission for consideration and appropriate action. 575 (Transmitted to Contracting Parties 20 December 2019) ACKNOWLEDGING that ICCAT has adopted the Recommendation by ICCAT amending the Recommendation 18-02 establishing a multi-annual management plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Rec. 19-04); NOTING that paragraphs 8 and 117 of Recommendation 19 -04 calls for a discussion on potential additional measures for further strengthening the control and traceability of live bluefin tuna; FURTHER NOTING that ICCAT has a dopted Recommendation 17 -061 establishing an interim conservation and management plan for Western Atlantic bluefin tuna; CONSIDERING that additional measures on control and traceability may be required to reinforce the efforts made over the past years for the recovery of bluefin tuna in the ICCAT Convention area; CONSIDERING that the constitution of a Working Group under Panel 2 would contribute to facilitate progress on control and traceability measures on bluefin tuna through the discussion and exchanges drawing on the expertise available from all the Contracting Parties concerned; RECOGNIZING that this Working Group should be initiated without delay; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1.

The Online Reporting Technology Working Group shall continue to work virtually and meet intersessionally as required in order to develop the Integrated Online Management System and complete its work plan. 2. The Working Group shall remain active following the completion of its work plan, which may be revised and amended as necessary, and until such time as the Commission decides otherwise. The tasks of the Working Group after the completion of its work plan shall be: a) To oversee the incorporation into the online reporting system of any new Annual Report requirements; b) To determine any redundant requirements for which reporting is no longer necessary; c) With appropriate input from the Commission, to oversee development of additional system modules covering other ICCAT reporting requirements in order to establish a comprehensive and fully integrated online reporting system; and d) Other tasks as the Commission may identify. 3. In carrying out the above tasks, the Working Group shall work in consultation with the SCRS, Compliance Committee, and other subsidiary bodies of the Commission as necessary and appropriate. 4. The Working Group shall continue to provide annual updates to the Commission regarding its activities, including presenting its proposal(s) for the content and format of the online reporting system and related modules for the Commission’s consideration in order to inform design and development. 5. This Recommendation supplements the Recommendation by ICCAT for the Development of an Online Reporting System (Rec. 16-19) and repeals and replaces the Recommendation by ICCAT to Continue the Development of an Integrated Online Reporting System (Rec. 19-12). 578 21-22 TOR RESOLUTION BY ICCAT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A WORKING GROUP ON THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING SYSTEMS (EMS) (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 2 December 2021) CONSIDERING the need for effective monitoring and control of ICCAT fisheries in order to ensure the conservation and management of the stocks managed by ICCAT; RECOGNIZING that technological development, in particular electronic monitoring systems (EMS) can be used to improve control and constitutes a significant means for authorities to ensure compliance with the applicable rules; CONSIDERING that technological developments are considerably advancing each year and that related tools should be explored on a regular basis to improve the management of ICCAT fisheries; ACKNOWLEDGING the benefits, including potential cost savings of implementing EMS on commercial fishing vessels; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that EMS can enhance the collection of fisheries data for scientific and management purposes; REITERATING that additional measures on control and traceability may be required to reinforce the efforts made over the past years for the recovery of fish stocks in the ICCAT Convention area. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. An Electronic Monitoring Systems (EMS) Working Group is established with the objective of exploring the use of available EMS technologies (e.g. closed circuit televisions and artificial intelligence) in ICCAT fisheries, with a focus on commercial fisheries, in order to improve the effectiveness of monitoring and control as well as the collection of scientific data, taking into account the needs and specificities of each fishery. 2. The EMS Working Group should carry out the following tasks: a) To compile and evaluate the most relevant reports, documents and other sources of information relating to experiences on the use and implementation of EMS; b) Identify the objective and purpose of potential applications of EMS in ICCAT fisheries, including considering potential improvements that could be achieved in vessel monitoring and control from the use of EMS, including preventing inaccurate catch reportin g and improving the reliability and coverage of collected data, as well as addressing IUU fishing; c) To identify challenges and limitations relating to the use of EMS; d) To explore the costs associated with implementing EMS for the different technical solutions available on the market; e) To identify the type of activities that can be recorded and the data that can be collected by the system depending on the type of fishing activity and fishing vessel; f) To identify which components of the fishing operations should be monitored; g) To compare the use of data collected through human observers and EMS, and evaluate the potential of EMS to enhance, supplement and possibly offer alternatives to human observers under appropriate circumstances; 579 h) Where needed and appropriate, to propose and evaluate pilot projects on the use of EMS in ICCAT fisheries; assess and draw lessons from pilot projects on the use of EMS performed outside of the remit of this Working Group, including in non-ICCAT fisheries (e.g., other RFMOs, CPCs, etc.); i) To identify minimum standards and consider the specifications needed for the implementation of EMS technology by CPCs, including considerations such as: i. the technical requirements, such as minimum number and resolution of cameras, number and type of sensors, hardware, GPS, etc. and their position and installation on board relevant vessels; ii. data management specifications such as data standards, data transmission protocols, data confidentiality and data protection, data storage and period of storage, retrieval and data sharing; iii. criteria on the ownership and maintenance of EMS and the associated data; iv. requirements of any software that may be used to analyze the collected data and video footage, including capabilities in terms of system diagnostics function and the ability to create and transmit alerts and warnings; v. authorities or bodies entrusted with the data analysis, protocols for the data analysis, analyzing software and possible use of artificial intelligence; vi. roles and responsibilities of the different actors involved in the approval of the system and the implementation (e.g., operators/masters, suppliers, authorities, ICCAT Secretariat, or subsidiary bodies); j) To recommend implementation strategies and priorities for different ICCAT fisheries and implementation timelines, taking into account the relevant provisions of ICCAT Recommendations. 3. The EMS Working Group should meet for the first time as soon as practically possible after the adoption of this Resolution. 4. The Working Group will be assisted by the ICCAT Secretariat. To facilitate immediate work on this matter, the Working Group will be initially chaired by the Chair of the Permanent Working Group (PWG), unless and until the Working Group elects its own chair. The Working Group will consult, as needed and appropriate, with the SCRS in light of the ongoing work of that body on EMS, as well as where needed, with the Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures (IMM). 5. The ICCAT Secretariat will provide simultaneous interpretation in the three ICCAT languages (English, French and Spanish) during all Working Group meetings. 6. As part of the first meeting, the EMS Working Group should develop a workplan covering the period 2022-2024. The EMS Working Group will submit an annual progress report, including any recommendations to the PWG for appropriate action at least 30 calendar d ays in advance of the ICCAT Annual Meeting. 580 21-23 TOR RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ESTABLISHING A PROCESS TO ADDRESS LABOR STANDARDS IN ICCAT FISHERIES (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: 2 December 2021) RECOGNIZING that various international instruments speak to the issue of certain labor standards and labor abuses; RECALLING that the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO’s) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries provides that “States should ensure that fishing facilities and equipment as well as all fisheries activities allow for safe, healthy and fair working and living conditions and meet internationally agreed standards adopted by relevant international organizations”; AWARE OF work being done to address the issue of labor standards in the seafood sector in other relevant international organizations and fora, such as the International Labor Organization (ILO), Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the recommendations from the fourth meeting of the Joint FAO/ILO/International Maritime Organization (IMO) Ad Hoc Working Group on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing and Related Matters; WELCOMING the initial exchange on labor practices and potential labor abuses during the 2021 Integrated Monitoring Measures (IMM) Working Group meeting, during which some CPCs expressed their concern about the practice and stressed the urgency of addressing it; FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGING that unfair and abusive labor practices and unsafe working conditions are dire problems in international fisheries that must be both condemned in the strongest way possible and eliminated through effective CPC actions, taken collectively and individually; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT 1. An ad hoc Working Group on labor standards is established to identify actions that CPCs can take, individually and collectively, to improve labor standards in ICCAT fisheries, including through cooperation with other relevant international organizations and assista nce to developing CPCs in the development and strengthening of relevant domestic legislation on labor standards and in the enforcement of that legislation. 2. The ad hoc Working Group will meet intersessionally beginning in 2022, preferably in conjunction with another ICCAT intersessional meeting. All CPCs are encouraged to participate in the Working Group. At its first meeting, the Working Group will elect its chair. The Working Group may invite outside experts to support its work, as needed. 3. The ad hoc Working Group will report on the progress of its deliberations at the 2022 ICCAT Annual Meeting as well as provide its recommendations regarding the need for additional intersessional meetings. The Commission will consider this report and decide on next steps. 4. CPCs are strongly encouraged to immediately take all appropriate actions under domestic and international law to improve and enforce requirements regarding labor standards and the prohibition of labor abuses including by, where applicable, strengthening th ese effective controls over vessels flying their flag that participate in ICCAT fisheries or in fishing -related activities that support such fishing. 581 23-22 TOR RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON ESTABLISHMENT OF A STANDING CATCH DOCUMENT SCHEME WORKING GROUP (CDS WG) (Entry into force 18 June 2024) RECALLING that ICCAT agreed at the 2019 Annual Commission meeting that detailed discussion should be continued without prejudging the future course of development of Catch Document Schemes (CDS); FURTHER RECALLING that the Ad Hoc Working Group on CDS, established by the Resolution by ICCAT Establishing an ICCAT Working Group on a Catch Document Scheme (Res. 21-21), exchanged views among CPCs on the expansion of CDS to other ICCAT species; RECOGNIZING the ever-increasing market demand for fishery products whose legality are verified; NOTING the successful development and implementation of an electronic bluefin tuna Catch Documentation Scheme in ICCAT; RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT on a process towards the establishment of a catch certification scheme for tuna and tuna-like species (Rec. 12-09); EMPHASIZING the need to implement a risk-based approach with respect to CDS; MINDFUL of the Voluntary Guidelines for Catch Documentation Schemes adopted by FAO in 2017, which set out guidance to States, RFMOs, regional economic integration organizations, and other intergovernmental organizations when developing and implementing new CDS, or harmonizing or reviewing existing CDS; RECOGNISING that the Convention amendment process consisted of two parts, i.e., the first part focused on the review of the Convention and the second part focused on developing specific amendments, and a similar two-step approach could be a good way to proceed with the discussion on this issue; NOTING the concern that the number of Working Groups has been increasing and the need to streamline the work of the Commission; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS AS FOLLOWS: 1. A Standing Catch Document Scheme Working Group (CDS WG) shall be established. The CDS WG shall also incorporate the function of and replace the eBCD Technical Working Group, which includes review of the technical specifications of eBCD and possible improvements. 2. The CDS WG is open to all CPCs and accredited observers. 3. The CDS WG will elect its own Chair. 4. Simultaneous interpretation in the three ICCAT languages (English, French, Spanish) will be provided during the meetings of the CDS WG. 5. The CDS WG shall first consider which species and the product types should be covered by any CDS, taking into account the factors specified in paragraph 1 of Rec. 12 -09. With a view to facilitating the implementation of any expanded CDS by CPCs, a phased/step-by-step approach should be considered, including technical approach. The CDS WG will then decide on details of the operational and technical aspects of the CDS, based on the information/views provided by CPCs, particularly regarding practical and technical considerations with respect to the design and implementation of any CDS, including the following: 582 a) What practical and technical difficulties exist with respect to the design and implementation of CDS and how they might be overcome; b) Whether it is feasible and appropriate to expand the eBCD system to other species , or if developing a separate electronic system is more appropriate; c) What capacity development programmes for developing CPCs may be needed to support their implementation of any expanded CDS; d) How to avoid duplication with existing national and international schemes and reducing the workload of exporting CPCs, if possible; and e) How to ensure compatibility between CDS being developed or implemented in other tuna RFMOs. 6. The CDS WG shall also deal with technical issues related to the eBCD and possible expansion of the eBCD to other species if considered the appropriate tool. 7. The CDS WG shall, as far as possible, identify the key components to facilitate the implementation of any expanded CDS, including taking into account the special needs and requirements of developing CPCs, in both the design and implementation of such schemes, among others. 8. From 2024 to 2026, the CDS WG shall hold a meeting at least once a year unless otherwise decided by the Commission. If the CDS WG is held in -person, it should preferably be held in conjunction with an intersessional meeting, particularly the IMM Working Group, so that the Meeting Participation Fund can be efficiently utilized to support the participation of developing CPCs. If the CDS WG is held in conjunction with an IMM Working Group meeting, the total duration of these two meetings should be no more than five days, unless otherwise decided by the Commission. The CDS WG may meet to discuss technical issues related to the eBCD whenever the Chair of the CDS WG considers it necessary and logistically feasible. 9. The CDS WG will, if appropriate, develop and submit a draft recommendation on any expanded CDS to the 2026 Commission meeting or earlier, if possible . If the CDS WG cannot submit the draft recommendation in 2026, it shall propose a new workplan to the Commission for approval. 10. This Recommendation shall repeal and replace the Resolution by ICCAT establishing an ICCAT Working Group on a Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) (Res. 21-21). 583 24-17 TOR RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON THE APPLICATION OF THE INTEGRATED ONLINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (IOMS) (Entry into force 16 June 2025) RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT for the development of an Online Reporting System (Rec. 16-19) adopted by the Commission in 2016, and all of the benefits of developing an integrated online reporting system noted therein; FURTHER RECALLING the Recommendation by ICCAT to continue the development of an Integrated Online Reporting System (Rec. 21-20) adopted by the Commission in 2021; CONSIDERING the progress made to date by the Online Reporting Technology Working Group (WG-ORT) and the Secretariat to develop the Integrated Online Management System (IOMS) and the utility of the system to enhance compliance with ICCAT reporting requirements; NOTING that ICCAT’s Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) acknowledged in its 2022 report the importance of the IOMS project on the future of ICCAT and recommended that the Commission continue to support its development; DESIRING to continue to find ways to enhance the effective functioning of the Commission, including by reducing the burden associated with ICCAT reporting requirements for both the Secretariat and the CPCs and increasing access to valuable information; MINDFUL that IOMS was released into production in August 2021, and that CPCs were encouraged to submit various sections of their 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports using IOMS; HIGHLIGHTING that the Secretariat has offered multiple trainings and additional assistance to facilitate the use of IOMS; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. All CPCs shall, as soon as possible, submit to the Secretariat the information necessary to ensure the registration of the users with Administrator rights (CPC Administrator role) for IOMS. Access to and use of IOMS cannot occur for those CPCs who fail to register at least one Administrator. 2. Beginning in 2023, CPCs shall submit the relevant portions of their Annual Report (Section 3, Part 1 and Part 2) directly into IOMS. Submission of these portions of the Annual Report in other formats shall no longer be accepted by the Secretariat. 3. Notwithstanding Paragraph 2, upon exception granted by the Chair of the Compliance Committee, in consultation with the Chair of the WG-ORT and the Secretariat, CPCs may request assistance from the Secretariat to complete reporting requirements offline for upload into IOMS by the Secretariat.

Parties should respond to the ICCAT Survey on Statistic Collection Systems at the earliest possible date; 2. Parties with sufficient capacity for meeting fundamental data collection, quality assurance, and reporting obligations should make voluntary contributions in proportion to their catch level, to a special fund, managed at the Secretariat. These funds will be used for training in data collection and for supporting of scientific participation in SCRS data preparatory and stock assessment sessions by scientists from Parties with insufficient capacity to meet data collection, quality assurance, and reporting obligations. For 2004, this special fund should be initially established at 40,000 Euros and activities undertaken with these funds should be reviewed by the Commission at its 2004 meeting and annually thereafter. 3. A plan for reinstituting ICCAT port sampling should be developed by SCRS, including expected costs associated with this sampling, and presented to the Commission at its 2004 meeting for further consideration. 596 05-09 MISC RECOMMENDATION BY ICCAT ON COMPLIANCE WITH STATISTICAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS (Entry into force: 13 June 2006) WHEREAS the reporting of basic catch and effort statistics is a fundamental obligation of Contracting Parties under Article IX, Rule 2 of the Convention and for Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities and Fishing Entities under the terms of the 2003 Recommendation by ICCAT on Criteria for Attaining the Status of Cooperating Non-Contracting Party, Entity, or Fishing Entity in ICCAT [Rec. 03-20]; NOTING that, despite the adoption of numerous measures intended to address the matter, lack of compliance with reporting obligations has been a persistent problem for the Commission over the entire history of its work; FURTHER NOTING that SCRS has frequently identified incomplete, missing, or late data as a contributor to uncertainly in assessments for several stocks, a factor that limits its ability to formulate specific and science-based management advice; RECOGNIZING the need to establish a clear process and procedures to identify data gaps, particularly those that limit the ability of SCRS to conduct robust stock assessments, and to find appropriate means to address those gaps; RECALLING that the ICCAT Criteria for the Allocation of Fishing Possibilities (Reference Document 01 - 25) clearly links fishing access with the obligation to provide accurate data on fishing effort and catch; COGNIZANT of the differing levels of development of ICCAT’s membership and recalling the 2003 Resolution by ICCAT on Improvements in Data Collection and Quality Assurance [Res. 03-21]; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RECOMMENDS THAT: 1. The Secretariat shall prepare, as part of its annual report on statistics and research, a list of specific data elements that are lacking for each stock. Such listing shall indicate the missing data elements pertaining to catch, by -catch, effort, and/or si ze composition, by fleet, gear, and fishing area to the extent such fishing operations are presumed to have occurred based on secondary sources. 2. In view of the report of the Secretariat, SCRS shall provide: a) an evaluation of the extent to which missing data have adversely affected the most recent assessment or update, b) an appraisal of the effect on new stock assessments if the data remain unavailable or incomplete, and c) the consequences of the data deficiencies with respect to the formulation of management advice. 3. Each Contracting Party and Cooperating non -Contracting Party, Entity, or Fishing Entity (CPC) shall provide an explanation regarding its reporting deficiencies including the reasons underlying the identified data gaps, capacity challenges and plans for co rrective action. The Commission, through the Compliance Committee or Permanent Working Group for the Improvement of ICCAT Statistics and Conservation Measures (PWG), as appropriate, shall evaluate the information provided by the Secretariat, SCRS and CPCs under this Recommendation. 597 4. Based on the information provided under Paragraphs 1 -3, the Compliance Committee or PWG shall identify problematic data deficiencies and recommend appropriate actions by the respective CPC to address the problem. In making this determination, the Compliance Committee or PWG shall take into account: a) any explanations and/or plans for corrective action, b) the responsible CPC’s record of late, incomplete, and/or missing data submissions, c) the extent to which the responsible CPC has requested and/or received data collection assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization, other CPCs, the Secretariat, including through the data fund established by the 2003 Resolution by ICCAT on Improvements in Data Collection and Quality Assurance [Res. 03-21], or others, and d) the effect of the data deficiency(ies) on the Commission’s ability to determine the status of the stock(s) and on the effectiveness of the ICCAT conservation and management measures. 598 05-11 MISC RESOLUTION BY ICCAT ON PELAGIC SARGASSUM (Transmitted to Contracting Parties: December 14, 2005) RECALLING that the Commission is responsible for the study of the populations of tuna and tuna -like fishes and that such study includes research on the abundance, biometry and ecology of the fishes, the oceanography of their environment, and the effects of natural and human factors upon their abundance; RECOGNIZING that pelagic Sargassum supports a diverse assemblage of marine organisms, including over 140 species of fish, and that the fishes associated with pelagic Sargassum include tuna and tuna -like species at different life stages; WHEREAS the greatest concentrations of pelagic Sargassum (Sargassum natans and S. fluitans ) are found within the North Atlantic Central Gyre in the Sargasso Sea, providing nutrients and habitat for large pelagic fish traversing the otherwise nutrient-poor, energy-poor open ocean; RECOGNIZING that certain stocks under ICCAT jurisdiction could be adversely impacted by a decline in the abundance of pelagic Sargassum, diminishing the Commission’s ability to maintain the stocks at maximum sustainable levels; RECALLING that the United Nations Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks calls for consideration of habitat and biodiversity in the marine environment, refers to the need to take ecosystem considerations into account, and that many cou ntries, including Contracting Parties, are moving to incorporate ecosystem considerations into fisheries management; FURTHER RECALLING that the Commission’s Sub -Committee on the Environment, meeting October 6, 2005, recommended expanding its area of research to ecosystem matters; CONFIRMING that the objective of including ecosystem considerations in fisheries management, including protection of fish habitat, is to contribute to long -term food security and to human development and to assure the effective conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem and its resources; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) RESOLVES THAT: 1. Contracting Parties, n on-Contracting Parties, Entities and Fishing Entities, where appropriate, undertake to provide to the SCRS information and data on activities that impact pelagic Sargassum in the Convention area on the high seas, directly or indirectly, with particular emphasis in the Sargasso Sea. 2.

At its 2024 Annual meeting, the Commission should discuss how best to ensure that ICCAT has an active role in the discussions leading up to the implementation of these instruments, including by adding a standing agenda item on this issue to the annual meetings of the Commission and SCRS. 615 23-24 MISC REVISED GUIDELINES FOR THE PREPARATION OF ANNUAL REPORTS (Official transmission: 18 December 2023) 1. Introduction The purpose of Annual Reports is to provide a mechanism for the submission to ICCAT of relevant information on the tuna-related activities of Contracting Parties and Cooperating non -Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities (CPCs) during the preceding year. 2. Submission process Complete Annual Reports, comprising Sections 1-3, should be submitted in two parts by 15 September each year as follows: a) through a Word document, in two parts, described by sections 1 and 2 below; and b) through two tables in the Integrated Online Management System (IOMS), described by section 3 below. The layout of the Word file should follow the structure and format specified below and must be in one of the official languages of ICCAT (English, French or Spanish). However, if the SCRS meeting takes place prior to 22 September, Section 1 should be submitted to the SCRS one week before the start of the SCRS Plenary Session (i.e., by 9:00 am on the first day of the Species Groups meetings), as notified to the Commission by the Secretariat. 3. Annual Report sections The Word file portion of the Annual Report should contain specific, separate sections on fisheries, research, management and inspection activities and may optionally include appendices containing additional information pertinent to these sections. Informat ion presented in Annual Reports should be divided into the relevant sections to facilitate the extraction and copying of particular information required by the Commission and its subsidiary bodies. The overall structure of the Word file should be as follows: Summary A summary (not to exceed 20 lines, or half a page) must be included with the report. This summary should be submitted in one (or more) of the three official languages of the Commission (English, French or Spanish). The ICCAT Secretariat will translate these summaries to the other official two languages. Section 1: Information on fisheries, research and statistics Please note that national fisheries information and information on research and statistics should be concise. Detailed information of a more scientific nature, or for discussion by individual Species Groups, should be presented to the SCRS as a scientific paper. Fisheries statistics should be reported separately by the Statistical Correspondent in accordance with the ICCAT Request for Atlantic tuna and shark statistics. 1.1 Annual fisheries information This report section should provide complementary information relating to the data submitted to ICCAT on total catches, effort, size-frequency, biological sampling and tagging data and briefly describe trends in tuna fisheries during the preceding year. Att ention should be given to changes in fishing patterns or new developments in fisheries, as well as any socio -economic factors which influence or explain such changes and developments. 616 1.2 Research and statistics This report section should provide a description of the statistical data collection systems implemented by CPCs to monitor fisheries for tuna and tuna -like species, with an indication of the degree of coverage of catch, effort and size data for fishing operations in both the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and High Seas. Attention should be given to problems, changes and improvements in such statistical systems and, where possible, the coverage of retained catches of target and bycatch species, and of discard ed catches, whether the animal is dead or alive. This section should also present summarized information on tuna-related research activities and results of particular interest to ICCAT, such as research related to stock delineation, stock assessment, migration and environmental factors. A brief description and summarized results of observer programmes may also be included in this section. A list of the information submitted to the Secretariat in accordance with Commission requirements and which is to be reviewed by the SCRS should also be included in Part 1 for submission to the SCRS. Section 2: Information on conservation and management measures 2.1 Implementation of ICCAT conservation and management measures This section should summarise the legislation adopted and other relevant measures taken to ensure the implementation of the active ICCAT conservation and management measures that are not included in the Online Reporting Section below, and any other informa tion of interest to the Commission. Titles of any relevant legislation should be translated into one of the official languages of ICCAT. This section should not exceed four pages in length. 2.2 Difficulties encountered in implementation of and compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures This section should outline any difficulties encountered in implementing ICCAT conservation and management measures and/or explanations of why reporting requirements or deadlines could not be met, and any steps that have been or are being taken to overcome these difficulties. In addition, if standard forms have not been used, a brief indication of the difficulties encountered in the use of these forms should be included. Appendices (if any) Appendices may be included as a supplement to the information contained in the main body of the Annual Reports to be submitted to ICCAT. The purpose of such Appendices should be to provide detailed supplementary information to the main sections of the Annu al Reports. As such, information contained in the Appendices should be considered to have been formally transmitted to the ICCAT Secretariat, as will be the contents of the body of the Annual Reports. However, such Appendices will not be included in the subsequent publication of Annual Reports but will be made available on request1. Section 3: Online reporting Information on reporting requirements must be made through the IOMS, as required by Recommendation 22-17. Online reporting comprises two parts, and upon completion, IOMS will generate two tables: Part 1 2: Research and Statistics reporting (in accordance with the request for statistics on Atlantic tunas and associated species in the ICCAT Convention area circulated annually by the Secretariat). Part 23:Management reporting. 1 Appendices which, due to their length, format, presentation or the complexity of the data, cannot be directly transferred int o the document compiling all the Annual Reports will not be published. 2 Formerly Part 1, Annex 1. 3 Formerly Part 2, Section 3. 617 Help files are integrated into the IOMS, but any CPC requiring assistance with access to or reporting through the IOMS should contact the Secretariat through general@ioms.iccat.int. Please ensure that you are responding to the latest requirement and that your response is appropriate, as changes from previous years may have taken place. Some requirements in the table allow you to indicate whether a requirement is applicable by means of a checkbox. In other cases, mandatory requirements cannot be deselected using the checkbox. A checkbox that is not interactive is indicated by shading. If a requirement is applicable, the corresponding date and/or a sentence that explains how it was fulfilled must be completed. In the event that a requirement is not applicable, the reason why it is not applicable must be provided in the appropriate cell. Responses provided in such cases should not contain the text "not applicable" and the explanation should not repeat this text since deselecting the checkbox already defines that the requirement is not applicable. It is recommended not to fill in the requirements of Tables 1 and 2 with references to previous years or previously cited elements. Examples of text to avoid using include: "like last year," "like the previous requirement," “see above,” etc. Where date of submission is requested in the IOMS, the date should pertain to the current year, even though the submission made may contain information pertaining to the previous year. For example , Task 1 submitted on 31 July 2023, which contains data for 2022; the response in the Annual Report template would be 31 July 2023. 4. Formats General text must be in Cambria 10 (see margins below). Section headings are standardized; further sub-headings should be short, reflect a logical sequence, and follow the rules of multiple subdivision (i.e., there can be no subdivision without at least 2 two sub-headings). The entire text should be intelligible to readers and, therefore, acronyms and abbreviations should be written out and all lesser-known technical terms should be defined the first time they are mentioned. Dates should be written as follows: 10 November 2003. Measures should be expressed as metric units, e.g., metric tons (t). Tables should be placed after the text, followed by the figure(s); they should be in MSWord files. Tables should be cited in numerical order in the text. Tables should be numbered (Arabic) and the table heading should be included above the table; avoid using grid s. Headings in tables should be short but sufficient to allow the table to be intelligible on its own. All unusual symbols should be explained in the table legend. Other incidental comments may be footnoted. Figures should be in MSWord files and placed after tables. Figures should be cited in numerical order in the text. Figures should be numbered (Arabic) and the figure caption should be included beneath the figure; avoid using grids. Clearly identify numerical scales, units and legends for the X- and Y-axes for each figure. If graphics are prepared in colour, please be sure that the information plotted or depicted can also be easily read in black and white (e.g., use ▪,♦,•, etc. or colours that are easily distinguishable).
